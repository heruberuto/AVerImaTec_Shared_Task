Wars of the future will continue to involve the collaboration of multiple nations - no one fights alone anymore. A key element in this joint exercise is the exchange of aviation assets. This particular night has Canadian piloted CH-47 Chinooks and U.S. manned UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. They will be working together to transport Canadian infantryman from CFB Cold Lake to attack nearby objectives. At these sites the Canadians will fight the opposing force - played by the British military. Outside a massive jet hangar stands an equally large man named Maj. Cole Petersen. An infantryman hailing from Cornell, British Columbia, he is the Deputy Commanding Officer for the 3rd Battalion Princess Patricia\\'s Canadian Light Infantry. It is a versatile combat unit dating back to World War I, and has the capability of conducting both airborne and mountain operations. Petersen watches his men on the flight line prepare for the arrival of helicopters. \"We wish to demonstrate the ability to rapidly project force across long distances through the use of air power,\" he explains. \"It is very much a team effort between the infantry and the aviators to project that force.\" Before long the rumble of other aircraft approach the runway. In response, the brute pivots around to face his intruders. A pack of three Black Hawk helicopters swoop in and reveal themselves. They are American friends. When they set down on the tarmac their crew chiefs step out of the mechanical birds and signal to the Canadians it is time to go fight. Among these aviators is U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer 3 Joel N. Barlow of Company A, 1st Battalion, 168th Aviation Regiment. He and his crew are a long way from their home in Boise, Idaho, but seem to be enjoying the mission and thrill of flying outside the U.S. ', 'context_after': 'They have operated in almost every environment imaginable, from the deserts in Iraq to the frozen fields of Antarctica. But most important of all is their ability to carry anywhere from 30 to 50 troops over 1,400 miles one-way. When heavy lifting is needed, the Army calls in Chinooks. Yet even the toughest workhorse has its bad nights. The Chinooks receive the last remaining troops and raise their ramps. After the aircraft begin to leave CFB Cold Lake it soon becomes apparent something is wrong. Radio communication reveals one of the helicopters in the formation has an engine failure. It decides to return. Despite a full load of troops inside, limited visibility, and one engine, the pilot skillfully sets the bird down safely. \"That guy ... just landed a Chinook with one engine ...\" an awed onlooker remarks. The men of C Company march off the wounded Chinook and move inside the hangar. Perhaps disappointed they are not with their comrades, the troops are no doubt thankful they made it to the ground in one piece. Meanwhile, kilometers away, a battle begins to rage. The mission could still go forward despite the setback, Petersen later explained. \"We plan ahead for these sort of things.\" In the midst of the excitement something went missing. The large grey brute is now gone. Taken to the skies again. He, like his U.S. and Chinook compatriots, still has much work left to do before the night is over. '}, page_content='\"It is a great opportunity for us to learn from the Canadians. I think they are happy we are here to help support this exercise,\" Barlow remarks. \"The mission ... certainly stands out in my mind. It was complex, it was exciting, and it was a lot of fun to do.\" Troops approach the birds and begin stepping through the slide doors of Barlow\\'s Black Hawk. The transition is busy but orderly. Soon reports come in Canadian Chinooks are also inbound, and suddenly CFB Cold Lake starts to feel a bit crowded. Regardless, Petersen surveys the scene with no signs of distress visible on his face. \"The most difficult part of this operation has actually been the planning,\" the major says. \"This operation encompassed a parachute assault, a tactical air landing operation, as well as an air assault by aviation elements from two different nations - all within the span of 12 hours.\" Coincidentally Barlow would later comment on the planning of tonight\\'s operation too. \"The Canadians seem to be pretty squared away. They show up to do business,\" he said. \"I\\'ve been really impressed with their flight planning process - how they meticulously plan the missions.\" The last infantryman quickly hops aboard as the crew chief slides the door shut behind him. With the Black Hawks full, Barlow and crew take off with their Canadian cargo. \"I hope the junior Soldiers will understand how versatile working with the [Canadian] Air Force or U.S. Army aviation makes them,\" Petersen says. \"We have a lot of coalition assets because that is the way all of our operations have been for the last 15 to 20 years.\" It is calm for a moment after the U.S. birds disappear. The pause is short-lived, however, by the approach of Canadian Chinooks. The brawny twin-engine helicopters waste no time landing in front of the next wave of troops. The Chinook is the helicopter equivalent of a tank. It is a massive flying machine weighing roughly 12 tons and capable of speeds over 190 mph.

Last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Kyiv and announced another $500 million in military aid, along with donations of 288 AIM-7 missiles and 10,000 rounds of ammunition. That is on top of donations from the Canadian Armed Forces inventory of dozens of air defence missiles; eight Leopard 2 tanks and ammunition; an armoured recovery vehicle; four M777 howitzers and 33,000 rounds of associated ammunition; 100 Carl Gustaf M2 rifles plus accessories; 4,200 rocket launchers; and 1,800 rounds of tank training ammunition. Canada has also donated winter clothing and other personal protective equipment, 640,000 meal packs and more than $10 million worth of small arms including sniper rifles, machine guns, pistols, anti-tank rockets and carbines. Much more equipment has been procured directly — and quickly — for Ukrainian forces, bypassing Canada\\'s usual procurement process. David Perry, president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute, said that\\'s necessary, but he wonders when the government will put more emphasis on replacing what\\'s been sent to Ukraine. \"If I were wearing a Canadian Army uniform, I would be noticing that we have been equipping the Ukrainian army, in a matter of months in some cases, with pieces of equipment the Canadian Army has been waiting years or decades for,\" he said. Perry said Canada\\'s typical procurement process is elaborate, in contrast with what the government has done to buy equipment for Ukraine, which is \"basically just going out and window-shopping in a hurry.\" While she stressed that the Latvian deployment is not a donation, Anand acknowledged Friday that Canada\\'s efforts to support Ukraine do put a strain on the Armed Forces\\' resources. '}, page_content='OTTAWA - The Canadian Armed Forces will deploy 15 Leopard 2 battle tanks and about 131 personnel to a NATO force in Latvia by next spring, Defence Minister Anita Anand said Friday. Anand made the announcement from Brussels, where she was meeting with defence ministers from countries that support Ukraine\\'s efforts to fight Russia\\'s invasion. The tanks and support vehicles will come from Gagetown, N.B., and Edmonton. \"There will be 15 Leopard 2 A4M tanks, two armoured recovery vehicles and then a variety of maintenance and fuel and supply and transport vehicles,\" Anand said, adding the deployment will consist of a total of 50 vehicles, including the tanks. The Leopard 2 A4M is one of Canada\\'s main battle tanks. They have been deployed in Afghanistan in the past and have mine-clearing capabilities. It\\'s expected that the equipment will arrive in Latvia by the fall, with the full group of personnel in place by next spring. Canada already leads a 10-country NATO battlegroup in Latvia with about 700 Canadian troops. \"We are continually deploying resources there as part of our role as the framework nation of the enhanced forward presence battle group on NATO\\'s eastern flank,\" Anand said. The military alliance has battle groups in Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia in response to Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine. Members agreed at the 2022 summit in Brussels to a new model that will involve more high-readiness troops and brigade-size formations in the area. At the time, Anand announced that she had signed a deal with Latvia to scale up the 2,000-person battle group to a deployment-ready brigade of about 4,000 troops. The details of those contributions have not been finalized, more than a year later. Canada aims to buy and deploy anti-tank weapons, counter-drone and air defence systems, ammunition and explosives as part of its commitment, but with the Armed Forces facing a severe personnel shortage, it remains unclear how many additional troops it can commit.

These reports came after Jordan and the US kicked off war drills on Sunday known as Eager Lion with about 7,400 troops from more than 20 nations taking part. Jordanian and American officials say the military drills which include aspects of border security, cyber-defense, and \"command and control\" exercises are meant to bolster coordination in response to threats including \"terrorism\".

While trends demonstrate a shift towards increased interstate competition, non-state actors will continue to play an important role in current and future conflicts. Violent extremism and international crime will continue to threaten populations and erode stability.7 State and non-state actors can also work in unison to gain plausible deniability, augment or diversify power projection, or garner greater resources.8 The probability of conflict is enlarged by increasingly adverse national conditions. Climate change remains a pervasive threat, one that modifies the operational environment for the Canadian Army. Internationally, it moves and intensifies the factors noted earlier, affecting existing flashpoints or creating new ones. It also generates demand for humanitarian and disaster relief interventions abroad. Domestically, the frequency of Operation LENTUS deployments to assist civilian authorities has significantly risen in past years, putting pressure on the Canadian Army’s readiness and resources. Climate change is directly affecting how the Canadian Army trains for and executes its missions. It can expect continued impacts on readiness, sustainment, and force employment activities. The effects of climate change are perhaps most pronounced in the Arctic. Rising activity levels in Canada’s Arctic by state and commercial actors raise the potential for safety and security-related challenges. These include search and rescue operations, response to natural or man-made disasters, and response to actions by states with interests in the Arctic. The Canadian Army must be ready to assist in addressing those challenges through exercises, cooperation with domestic partners, and by providing a physical presence when needed. The Canadian Arctic is an unforgiving environment, and deploying and sustaining troops there may require adjustments in the Canadian Army’s structure.9 ', 'context_after': 'Security force capacity building in Operations UNIFIER, IMPACT,10 NABERIUS11 and others is increasingly common and underpinned by Canadian Army soldiers’ proficiency and reputation. The Canadian Army also supports GC objectives through army-to-army relationships that produce operational and tactical benefits and support strategic priorities. States that fail to adapt their use of land forces to the contemporary operating environment will come second place to more innovative and creative competitors.12 Domestically, positive social changes on numerous fronts are driving the CAF to reflect deeply, and to embrace and promote diversity within its ranks. The importance of adopting appropriate recruitment, retention, integration, inclusion, personnel management, and welfare policies is vital to the Canadian Army. It will continue to contribute to CAF diversity targets and eliminate unacceptable behaviours related to harassment or hateful conduct. The expectations of Canadians for members in uniform have always been higher than for most, if not all, other Canadian institutions. This is necessary as the CAF is the only one that legally applies disciplined violence on behalf of the state. While the Canadian Army will continue to promote diversity for moral and ethical reasons, it recognizes that diversity is also a force multiplier for organizations as it varies patterns of thinking and creates operational opportunities in theatres of various demographic profiles. In addition to societal expectations related to social priorities, there is an ever-greater requirement and appreciation for CAF and Canadian Army assistance during domestic crises. The rising frequency of Operation LENTUS deployments has already been noted above. The Canadian Army’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as part of Operation LASER,13 is a reminder that armies have to be ready to provide expertise not only to address pandemics—which are likely to remain an extant challenge—but also other crises. '}, page_content='Other challenges and threats to national and continental defence are surfacing. New missile and long-range capabilities—to include cyber—imply that Canada can no longer assume geographically-assured safety. The current defence policy, SSE, makes the defence of Canada and North America a core mission for the CAF but leaves considerable policy development space to adapt to the changing context. The Canadian Army will look to play a primary role in any continental defence approach that the Government of Canada (GC) might adopt in the future. While other domains of warfare provide advantages, land power remains the most decisive component in winning conflicts in the land domain. Populations reside in the land domain, and thus land forces are key to engaging with and protecting them through physical presence. Moreover, the employment of land forces is a tangible expression of national commitment for international partners—it indicates that a country has “skin in the game.” In all deployments, our land forces, through physical presence, contribute significantly to the grass roots perception of our nation around the world, adding to its ‘soft power.’ The perception of our professionalism, proficiency, and adherence to values is one of the nation’s strongest ambassadors. The information domain is now central to modern conflict, and land forces can increasingly expect to be called upon to create an effect in it. Operation REASSURANCE, for example, is in part an information operation executed in the land domain through its creation of deterrence and reassurance effects. Indeed, while a persistent physical presence is arguably the most effective deterrent against predatory adversaries, even the demonstration of expeditionary warfighting capabilities achieves a deterrent effect causing potential adversaries to change their decision calculus. The Canadian Army will increasingly operate across a variety of mission sets, once considered non-traditional, to achieve GC objectives.

The base is at Yelnya, southeast of the city of Smolensk and some 160 miles from the Ukrainian border. Large amounts of weaponry were moved there late in 2021 – including some 700 tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and ballistic missile launchers. Much of that equipment is now gone, according to radar satellite imagery acquired on February 6. Cloud cover had prevented photographic imagery of the site for several days previously. The images show the tracks of departing vehicles. Stephen Wood, senior director at satellite imagery company Maxar, told CNN: “It looks to me like a considerable amount of the vehicles [tanks, self-propelled artillery and other support vehicles] have departed from the northeastern vehicle park; additional armored vehicles departed from the more central vehicle park.” ‘Entering the new stage of the build-up’ Konrad Muzyka, an expert in tracking military movements with Rochan Consulting, says what has happened at Yelnya is one of several “important changes in Russian force compositions and their locations.” He told CNN: “We are entering the new stage of the build-up where we are seeing pre-positioned units being manned with additional personnel and that equipment is being moved probably to staging areas.” Social media videos shot in the last few days show some of that equipment on trains and roads much further south in the Bryansk region, which is close to Ukraine. The armor and vehicles are identifiably from the same units that had pre-positioned at Yelnya. ', 'context_after': 'Muzyka says there are substantial Russian movements elsewhere. “We are seeing a massive influx of vehicles and personnel in Kursk,” he tweeted Sunday. Kursk is some 70 miles (100 kilometers) from the border with Ukraine. Phillip Karber of the Potomac Foundation in Washington, who has also studied Russian troop movements in detail, told CNN: “Russia’s strongest offensive formation – the First Guards Tank Army, which is normally stationed in the Moscow area – has moved south 400 kilometers and is assembling in the optimum area for a rapid armored offensive on the Khursk-Kyiv invasion route.” On Sunday, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told ABC News: “We believe that there is a very distinct possibility that Vladimir Putin will order an attack on Ukraine. It could take a number of different forms. It could happen as soon as tomorrow or it could take some weeks yet.” Separately US officials told CNN at the weekend that Russian President Vladimir Putin has now assembled 70% of the military personnel and weapons on Ukraine’s borders he would need for a full-scale invasion of the country. This includes a growing force in southern Belarus. '}, page_content='“We know that Yelnya hosts elements of the 41st army of the CMD [Russia’s Central Military District] that arrived from Siberia last spring to a training ground near Voronezh and whose vehicles were later moved to Yelnya,” Russian journalist Rusland Leviev of the Conflict Investigation Team (CIT), a Russian open-source intelligence group, told CNN. Social media videos around Bryansk show military vehicles with “76” and “87” codes on their number plates which denote the CMD, he pointed out. Leviev added that the CIT believes the vehicles are moving to Bryansk, “because we saw two videos of the same convoy in Smolensk region and then in Bryansk region to the south,” which the group geolocated against crowdsourced dashcam footage and satellite imagery. “We also saw videos of several trains that were posted by social media users from Bryansk region. On the carriages we could read 8-digit identification codes, which, when checked against openly accessible databases, trace the train’s origins to Yelnya.” “This is important because those vehicles previously were several hundred kilometers away from the border, and now [they] are stopping in mere dozens [of kilometers away].” Thomas Bullock, an analyst at Janes, wrote: “There are now multiple indicators suggesting troops have begun deploying to forward camps to join up with their prepositioned equipment.” He also added that videos posted on social media indicate that troops from Siberia, whose equipment has already been moved to sites in Smolensk and Bryansk, are in the process of deploying. A US intelligence document dated December 3, 2021 included satellite imagery showing that the site at Yelnya was empty in June – but by November was home to five Battalion Tactical Groups, each of which contains about 1,000 troops and supporting elements. Much of the equipment belongs to the 41st Combined Arms Army, which is normally based in Russia’s CMD and has its headquarters in Novosibirsk in Siberia.

Some studies were not synthesised because the participants in the study were identical to those in another included study, and examined the same outcome construct.

In such a case only one study was included in the synthesis sample to avoid double counting of participants. The second reason for studies not being synthesised was due to insufficient information to calculate an effect size. For example several studies provided an adjusted mean difference between treatment and control, but did not provide any raw standard deviation, or other statistics that would permit us to construct an effect size. The third reason for studies not being synthesised was receiving a score of 5 on any item in the risk of bias assessment.

Other deploying countries in the sample were Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Kuwait, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka (total of 28studies). One study did not report which country troops were deployed from. Most studies (88%) considered deployment to war zones. The remaining studies (9%) considered deployment to civil conflict zones. Twenty studies did not report on the type of deployment. 62% of deployed participants was army personnel. A smaller share of deployed participants was personnel of other military branches: Navy (14%), Air Force (15%), and Marines (9%). 70 studies did not report on the service branch of participants. At the study level 83% of the participants were males (30studies did not report on gender composition). Participants were 69% white Caucasian at the study level (not reported in 89studies), had an average age of 32 years (not reported in 52studies), and 56% were married (not reported in 72studies). At the study level 30% of participants had previously been deployed (not reported in 141 studies). 54% of the deployed participants were from the Active Component (regulars). The remaining share of participants consisted either of members from the Reserve Component (reserves) or members of the National Guard (not reported in 67 studies). Finally, 84% of the participants (at the study level) were enlisted personnel (not reported in 77studies). 4.1.2.1 Study characteristics: synthesis sample Table 1 presents study characteristics for all included studies. Table 4 presents the study characteristics for those studies where an effect size could be calculated and used in the meta‐analysis. This sample of studies forms the basis for the synthesis. We therefore refer to this sample of studies as the synthesis sample.

North Korea had criticized the drills, calling them a preparation for invasion, although the U.S. and South Korea insist they are defensive in nature.\\n\\nThe North’s declaration Friday is similar to its other warlike rhetoric in recent years, including repeated threats to reduce Seoul to a “sea of fire,” and the huge numbers of soldiers and military equipment already stationed along the border mean the area is always essentially in a “quasi-state of war.” Still, the North’s apparent willingness to test Seoul with military strikes and its recent warning of further action raise worries because South Korea has vowed to hit back with overwhelming strength should North Korea attack again.\\n\\nPyongyang says it did not fire anything at the South, a claim Seoul dismissed as nonsense.\\n\\nKim Jong Un ordered his troops to “enter a wartime state” and be fully ready for any military operations starting Friday evening, according to a report in Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency. The North also has given Seoul a deadline of tonight to remove border loudspeakers that, after a lull of 11 years, have started broadcasting anti-Pyongyang propaganda. Failure, Pyongyang says, will result in further military action. Seoul has vowed to continue the broadcasts.\\n\\nThe North’s media report said “military commanders were urgently dispatched for operations to attack South Korean psychological warfare facilities if the South doesn’t stop operating them.”\\n\\nSouth Korea’s Yonhap news agency, citing an unidentified government source, reported Friday that South Korean and U.S. surveillance assets detected the movement of vehicles carrying short-range Scud and medium-range Rodong missiles in a possible preparation for launches. South Korea’s Defense Ministry said it could not confirm the report.\\n\\nNorth Korea said the South Korean shells fired Thursday landed near four military posts but caused no injuries. No one was reported injured in the South, either, though hundreds were evacuated from front-line towns.\\n\\nThe loudspeaker broadcasts began after South Korea accused the North of planting land mines that maimed two South Korean soldiers this month. North Korea denies this, too.\\n\\nAuthoritarian North Korea, which has restarted its own propaganda broadcasts, is extremely sensitive to any criticism of its government, run by leader Kim Jong Un, whose family has ruled since the North was founded in 1948. The loudspeaker broadcasts are taken seriously in Pyongyang because the government does not want its soldiers and residents to hear outsiders criticize human rights abuses and economic mismanagement that condemns many to abject poverty, South Korean analysts say.\\n\\nMany in Seoul are accustomed to ignoring or discounting North Korea’s repeated threats, but the latest have caused worry because of Pyongyang’s warning of strikes if the South doesn’t tear down its loudspeakers by this evening. Observers say the North may need some save-facing measure to back down.\\n\\nThis is what happened in December 2010, when North Korea backed off an earlier warning of catastrophic retaliation after South Korea defiantly went ahead with live-fire drills near the country’s disputed western sea boundary. A month earlier, when South Korea staged similar drills, the North reacted with an artillery bombardment that killed four people on a South Korean border island. North Korea said it didn’t respond to the second drill because South Korea conducted it in a less provocative way, though the South said both drills were the same.\\n\\n### Share this:\\n\\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/21/north-korea-warns-of-war-with-south/?share=facebook&nb=1)\\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/21/north-korea-warns-of-war-with-south/?share=twitter&nb=1)\\n- [Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Reddit](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/21/north-korea-warns-of-war-with-south/?share=reddit&nb=1)\\n- [Click to print (Opens in new window)Print](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/21/north-korea-warns-of-war-with-south/#print?share=print&n', 'image': '67d0a15035531374f6dae467#CLAIM#2.jpg', 'metadata': {'title': 'North Korea warns of war with South – Orange County Register', 'description': 'PYONGYANG, North Korea – North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Friday declared his front-line troops in a “quasi-state of war” and ordered them to prepare for battle with South Korea a day after the most serious confrontation between the rivals in years.

Every Saturday from now until National Day on 09 Aug 2015 will be used to practice for the parade, including a fly past (next post will include photos of the fly past) and the fireworks display, which, unfortunately, I am not able to see from my balcony.\\n\\n[![SG50 Logo](https://i0.wp.com/ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SG50-Logo-300x300.jpg?resize=300%2C300&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SG50-Logo.jpg?ssl=1)\\n\\nAs this year is the 50th Anniversary of the Independence of Singapore, the National Day Celebrations and Parade will be even bigger than usual. The size of the parade and (probably) the fireworks will dwarf the previous years. This year the National Day Celebration will be held at the Padang with Nicholl Highway being used as the staging area for the vehicles that will showcase Singapore’s Military and Civil Defence capabilities.

Body bags can also be used for the storage of corpses within [morgues](https://alchetron.com/Morgue). Before purpose-made body bags were available, [cotton](https://alchetron.com/Cotton) [mattress](https://alchetron.com/Mattress) covers were sometimes used, particularly in combat zones during the Second World War. If not available, other materials were used such as bed sheets, blankets, shelter halves, ponchos, sleeping bag covers, tablecloths, curtains, parachute canopies, tarpaulins, or discarded canvas—“sealed in a blanket”—slang. However, the subsequent rubber (and now [plastic](https://alchetron.com/Plastic)) body bag designs are much superior, not least because they prevent leakage of body fluids, which often occurs after someone dies. The dimensions of a body bag are generally around 36 inches by 90 inches (91\\xa0cm by 229\\xa0cm). Most have some form of carrying handles, usually webbing, at each corner and along the edges.\\n\\n## Contents\\n\\n- [Young m a body bag official video](https://alchetron.com/Body-bag#Young-m-a-body-bag-official-video)\\n- [Llama llama body bags ft cl cliff dir wethepartysean](https://alchetron.com/Body-bag#Llama-llama-body-bags-ft-cl-cliff-dir-wethepartysean)\\n- [References](https://alchetron.com/Body-bag#References)\\n\\n![Body bag Amazoncom Primacare BB3201 Body BagStretcher Combo 90quot Length x](https://alchetron.com/cdn/body-bag-c0fa4c84-588f-429e-a20c-879f8a44f90-resize-750.jpeg)\\n\\nIn modern warfare, body bags have been used to contain the bodies of dead soldiers. Disaster agencies typically have reserves of body bags, both for anticipated wars and natural disasters. During the [Cold War](https://alchetron.com/Cold-War), vast reserves of body bags were built up in anticipation of millions of fatalities from [nuclear war](https://alchetron.com/Nuclear-warfare). This was the subject of [Adrian Mitchell](https://alchetron.com/Adrian-Mitchell)\\'s protest poem \"Fifteen Million Plastic Bags\".\\n\\n![Body bag https4imimgcomdata4RGUQMY1134920deadbo](https://alchetron.com/cdn/body-bag-ce767814-bbde-4add-a1ab-80254dd44b0-resize-750.jpg)\\n\\nBody bags are sometimes portrayed in films and television as being made of a heavy black plastic. Lightweight white body bags have since become popular because it is much easier to spot a piece of evidence that may have been jostled from the body in transit on a white background than on a black background. Even so, black body bags are still in general use. Other typical colors include orange, blue, or gray. Body bags used in the Vietnam War were heavy-duty black rubberized fabric. Regardless of their color, body bags are made of thick plastic and have a full-length [zipper](https://alchetron.com/Zipper) on them. Sometimes the zipper runs straight down the middle. Alternatively, the path of the zipper may be J-shaped or D-shaped. Depending on the design, there are sometimes handles (two on each side) to facilitate lifting. It is possible to write information on the plastic surface of a body bag using a marker pen, and this often happens—either in situ (particularly when a large number of bodies are being collected) or at the mortuary, before being stored in refrigerated cabinets. Alternatively, some designs of body bags have transparent label pockets as an integral part of the design, into which a name-card can be inserted. In any case, a conventional [toe tag](https://alchetron.com/Toe-tag) can easily be tied to one of the lifting handles if required. Body bags are not designed to be washed and re-used, with good reason: aside from the obvious hygiene concerns, re-use of body bags could easily contaminate evidence in the case of a suspicious death. As a result, body bags are routinely discarded and incinerated after one use. In Afghanistan US forces have used body bags to deliver ammunition, medical supplies, and rations to troops in the field. Fifty or so pounds of supplies are packed loose in a body bag and pulled out of the helicopter delivering them to be easily and rapidly dragged to cover by one or two soldiers.\\n\\n![Body bag Body Bag Manufacturers Suppliers amp Wholesalers](https://alchetron.com/cdn/body-bag-2717484f-3906-488b-9c15-22709eeab69-resize-750.jpg)\\n\\nAlthough body bags are most often used for the transport of human remains from their place of discovery to a [funeral home](https://alchetron.com/Funeral-home) or mortuary, they can also be used for temporary burials such as in a combat zone. In such situations, proper funerals are impossible because of imminent enemy attack. This was the situation during the [Falklands War](https://alchetron.com/Falklands-War) of 1982, during which British dead were placed in gray plastic body bags and then laid in mass graves. Some months after the conflict ended, all remains were exhumed from their temporary graves to receive a conventional funeral service with full military honors.\\n\\n![Body bag Skin Body Bag Think Tank Photo](https://alchetron.com/cdn/body-bag-69d773c9-5a55-4dd8-a8ac-8366acc9a97-resize-750.jpeg)\\n\\nThe term \"body bag\" is sometimes used for fashion or other bags worn on the body ( _sling body bag_ or _across body bag_) and this sense has no connection with either of the two above senses.\\n\\n![Body bag Prada Body Bag The Kloons YouTube](https://alchetron.com/cdn/body-bag-3def8a81-3ee6-4717-93a2-94cd2131e37-resize-750.jpeg)\\n\\nWith the addition of provision for breathing, specially ',\n",

Until that is fully established, it makes sense to use this as a potential additional identifier of patients having the virus,\" he said.\\n\\nTo collect more data on these symptoms in Covid-19, the AAO-HNS Infectious Disease and Patient Safety Quality Improvement Committees developed the Covid-19 Anosmia Reporting Tool for Clinicians. Using this tool, healthcare providers of all specialties can confidentially report loss of smell and taste related to Covid-19.\\n\\nAdvt\\n\\nThe tool assesses whether the source of Covid-19 infection is identifiable, risk factors for infections, onset of [anosmia and dysgeusia](https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/anosmia+and+dysgeusia) and what other symptoms started at the same time as anosmia and dysgeusia.\\n\\n\"The value of adding unexplained anosmia as a potential official symptom of Covid-19... would allow earlier detection and isolation of potential carriers and improve safety for healthcare workers,\" Denneny added.\\n\\n\\n- [PTI](https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/agency/87654375/PTI)\\n\\n- Published On Mar 29, 2020 at 11:50 AM IST\\n\\n- - Telegram\\n\\n- Facebook\\n\\n- Copy Link\\n\\n\\n## Comments\\n\\n![comment](https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/et-default-user_1.svg)\\n\\nWhat are your thoughts?\\n\\nComment NowRead Comment (1)\\n\\n## Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals.\\n\\n### Subscribe to Newsletter to get latest insights & analysis in your inbox.\\n\\n## All about ETHealthworld industry right on your smartphone!\\n\\n- [Download the ETHealthworld App](https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.co',\n",

One of them, though initially difficult for investigators to identify, turned out to be Ukrainian Red Cross volunteer Yevhenii Piskotin.\\n\\n“He was wearing a white shirt, his hands were bound, and he had a beard. He wasn’t from the village; we didn’t know him. Almost three weeks ago, we saw a post on social media that said they were searching for \\\\[missing\\\\] volunteers. From the pictures, we realized it had to be him,” said Andriivka resident Natalia Sidorenko, who worked with her husband to find bodies and bury them.\\n\\nWith the help of a satellite from the American company Planet Labs, journalists were able to determine that the minibus lying next to Piskotin’s body had been in the same spot since March 19. Piskotin had stopped responding to messages two weeks earlier. An employee from the Red Cross’s Poltava regional office said that Piskotin had driven his family to western Ukraine and disappeared on his way back. He was 35 years old. He left behind his mother, his wife, and his two children.\\n\\n### **Oleksiy Cherkovskyi**\\n\\nThe body of 31-year-old Andriivka resident Oleksiy Cherkovskyi was found not far from Piskotin’s body. According to Cherkovskyi neighbors, on the day he died, March 3, he was planning to leave the occupied village along with his family. He went home to get his passport and ran into Russian troops along the way.\\n\\n“The Russians asked him where he was going. He said he was going home. And they took him off somewhere,” said one Andriivka resident, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\\n\\nCherkovskyi was shot in the back.\\n\\n### **Yuriy Kravchenya**\\n\\nAccording to witnesses, Yuriy Kravchenya was shot in the courtyard outside his home in the early days of the occupation. Kravchenya, 46, lived on Andriivka’s main thoroughfare, Melya Street.\\n\\n“They didn't torture him; they just killed him in the courtyard. All we heard was gunfire,” said a village resident named Olga.\\n\\n### **Ihor Yermakov**\\n\\nThe body of 54-year-old Ihor Yermakov was found near an electrical substation. His hands were bound and his body lay face down. According to neighbors, Russian soldiers took Yermakov from his home on March 2.\\n\\n“They told him, ‘Our commander wants to speak with you’,” said Olga, another village resident, on March 2. She saw Yermakov when he was being taken away and again after he was found dead.\\n\\nUkrainian law enforcement officials suspect Russian soldier Daniil Frolkin of killing Yermakov. According to witness statements, Frolkin hit Yermakov multiple times before shooting him in the head. When the Russian investiga\",\n",

Andrew Cuomo was correct in predicting the Empire State had reached its peak and could soon see lowering daily death tolls.\\n\\n“I don’t want to jump the gun on that, but I think that is the case,” Fauci [said on the “Today” show](https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/1248208496782389250) Thursday.\\n\\n“I’m always very cautious about jumping the gun and saying, ‘Well, we have turned the corner’ but I think we are really looking at the beginning of that, which would really be very encouraging. We need that right now,” he said.\\n\\n[![Dr. Anthony Fauci](https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/fauci-new-york-curve-65.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=662)](https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/fauci-new-york-curve-65.jpg?quality=90&strip=all) Dr. Anthony FauciREUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\\n\\n“So we are hoping, with cautious optimism, that at the same time we’re in for a bad week, we’re going to start to see a turnaround. And I think it will.”\\n\\nHowever, he warned against people getting too excited by the news and lifting the isolation measures that he said have helped improve the crisis.\\n\\nFauci also said antibody tests that would let people know if they have already been infected — potentially allowing them to resume normal life — could be available sooner than expected.\\n\\n“The antibody tests are developed,” [he said](https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/1248210645826363392), saying that some are “validated to show they are consistent.”\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\n1 of 5\\n\\nNext\\n\\n![Medical workers at the emergency field hospital run by Samaritan's Purse and Mount Sinai Health System in Central Park.](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/fauci-new-york-curve-62.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=878) Medical workers at the emergency field hospital run by Samaritan's Purse and Mount Sinai Health System in Central ParkMisha Friedman/Getty Images\\n\\n![A body is moved from a refrigeration truck serving as a temporary morgue to a vehicle at the Brooklyn Hospital Center.](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/fauci-new-york-curve-63.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=878) A body is moved from a refrigeration truck serving as a temporary morgue to a vehicle at the Brooklyn Hospital Center.Bryan R.

North Korea had criticized the drills, calling them a preparation for invasion, although the U.S. and South Korea insist they are defensive in nature.\\n\\nThe North’s declaration Friday is similar to its other warlike rhetoric in recent years, including repeated threats to reduce Seoul to a “sea of fire,” and the huge numbers of soldiers and military equipment already stationed along the border mean the area is always essentially in a “quasi-state of war.” Still, the North’s apparent willingness to test Seoul with military strikes and its recent warning of further action raise worries because South Korea has vowed to hit back with overwhelming strength should North Korea attack again.\\n\\nPyongyang says it did not fire anything at the South, a claim Seoul dismissed as nonsense.\\n\\nKim Jong Un ordered his troops to “enter a wartime state” and be fully ready for any military operations starting Friday evening, according to a report in Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency. The North also has given Seoul a deadline of tonight to remove border loudspeakers that, after a lull of 11 years, have started broadcasting anti-Pyongyang propaganda. Failure, Pyongyang says, will result in further military action. Seoul has vowed to continue the broadcasts.\\n\\nThe North’s media report said “military commanders were urgently dispatched for operations to attack South Korean psychological warfare facilities if the South doesn’t stop operating them.”\\n\\nSouth Korea’s Yonhap news agency, citing an unidentified government source, reported Friday that South Korean and U.S. surveillance assets detected the movement of vehicles carrying short-range Scud and medium-range Rodong missiles in a possible preparation for launches. South Korea’s Defense Ministry said it could not confirm the report.\\n\\nNorth Korea said the South Korean shells fired Thursday landed near four military posts but caused no injuries. No one was reported injured in the South, either, though hundreds were evacuated from front-line towns.\\n\\nThe loudspeaker broadcasts began after South Korea accused the North of planting land mines that maimed two South Korean soldiers this month. North Korea denies this, too.\\n\\nAuthoritarian North Korea, which has restarted its own propaganda broadcasts, is extremely sensitive to any criticism of its government, run by leader Kim Jong Un, whose family has ruled since the North was founded in 1948. The loudspeaker broadcasts are taken seriously in Pyongyang because the government does not want its soldiers and residents to hear outsiders criticize human rights abuses and economic mismanagement that condemns many to abject poverty, South Korean analysts say.\\n\\nMany in Seoul are accustomed to ignoring or discounting North Korea’s repeated threats, but the latest have caused worry because of Pyongyang’s warning of strikes if the South doesn’t tear down its loudspeakers by this evening. Observers say the North may need some save-facing measure to back down.\\n\\nThis is what happened in December 2010, when North Korea backed off an earlier warning of catastrophic retaliation after South Korea defiantly went ahead with live-fire drills near the country’s disputed western sea boundary. A month earlier, when South Korea staged similar drills, the North reacted with an artillery bombardment that killed four people on a South Korean border island. North Korea said it didn’t respond to the second drill because South Korea conducted it in a less provocative way, though the South said both drills were the same.\\n\\n### Share this:\\n\\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/21/north-korea-warns-of-war-with-south/?share=facebook&nb=1)\\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/21/north-korea-warns-of-war-with-south/?share=twitter&nb=1)\\n- [Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Reddit](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/21/north-korea-warns-of-war-with-south/?share=reddit&nb=1)\\n- [Click to print (Opens in new window)Print](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/21/north-korea-warns-of-war-with-south/#print?share=print&n',\n",

The practice started at about 1pm and went through until around 10pm. Every Saturday from now until National Day on 09 Aug 2015 will be used to practice for the parade, including a fly past (next post will include photos of the fly past) and the fireworks display, which, unfortunately, I am not able to see from my balcony.\\n\\n[![SG50 Logo](https://i0.wp.com/ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SG50-Logo-300x300.jpg?resize=300%2C300&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SG50-Logo.jpg?ssl=1)\\n\\nAs this year is the 50th Anniversary of the Independence of Singapore, the National Day Celebrations and Parade will be even bigger than usual. The size of the parade and (probably) the fireworks will dwarf the previous years. This year the National Day Celebration will be held at the Padang with Nicholl Highway being used as the staging area for the vehicles that will showcase Singapore’s Military and Civil Defence capabilities. Nicholl Highway is the road directly below my balcony so I have a fantastic view of the staging area, these are some of the photos I took on 20 Jun 2015.\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01808.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01672.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01659.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01648.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01643.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01636.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01614.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01613.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01612.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01605.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01597.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01583.jpg?fit=640%2C427&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01565.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01554.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01549.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01546.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01533.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01532.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01528.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01523.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01808.jpg?resize=100%2C100&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01672.jpg?resize=100%2C100&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01659.jpg?resize=100%2C100&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Prac',\n",
