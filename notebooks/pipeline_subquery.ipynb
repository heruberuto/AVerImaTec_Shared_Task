Wars of the future will continue to involve the collaboration of multiple nations - no one fights alone anymore. A key element in this joint exercise is the exchange of aviation assets. This particular night has Canadian piloted CH-47 Chinooks and U.S. manned UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. They will be working together to transport Canadian infantryman from CFB Cold Lake to attack nearby objectives. At these sites the Canadians will fight the opposing force - played by the British military. Outside a massive jet hangar stands an equally large man named Maj. Cole Petersen. An infantryman hailing from Cornell, British Columbia, he is the Deputy Commanding Officer for the 3rd Battalion Princess Patricia\\'s Canadian Light Infantry. It is a versatile combat unit dating back to World War I, and has the capability of conducting both airborne and mountain operations. Petersen watches his men on the flight line prepare for the arrival of helicopters. \"We wish to demonstrate the ability to rapidly project force across long distances through the use of air power,\" he explains. \"It is very much a team effort between the infantry and the aviators to project that force.\" Before long the rumble of other aircraft approach the runway. In response, the brute pivots around to face his intruders. A pack of three Black Hawk helicopters swoop in and reveal themselves. They are American friends. When they set down on the tarmac their crew chiefs step out of the mechanical birds and signal to the Canadians it is time to go fight. Among these aviators is U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer 3 Joel N. Barlow of Company A, 1st Battalion, 168th Aviation Regiment. He and his crew are a long way from their home in Boise, Idaho, but seem to be enjoying the mission and thrill of flying outside the U.S. ', 'context_after': 'They have operated in almost every environment imaginable, from the deserts in Iraq to the frozen fields of Antarctica. But most important of all is their ability to carry anywhere from 30 to 50 troops over 1,400 miles one-way. When heavy lifting is needed, the Army calls in Chinooks. Yet even the toughest workhorse has its bad nights. The Chinooks receive the last remaining troops and raise their ramps. After the aircraft begin to leave CFB Cold Lake it soon becomes apparent something is wrong. Radio communication reveals one of the helicopters in the formation has an engine failure. It decides to return. Despite a full load of troops inside, limited visibility, and one engine, the pilot skillfully sets the bird down safely. \"That guy ... just landed a Chinook with one engine ...\" an awed onlooker remarks. The men of C Company march off the wounded Chinook and move inside the hangar. Perhaps disappointed they are not with their comrades, the troops are no doubt thankful they made it to the ground in one piece. Meanwhile, kilometers away, a battle begins to rage. The mission could still go forward despite the setback, Petersen later explained. \"We plan ahead for these sort of things.\" In the midst of the excitement something went missing. The large grey brute is now gone. Taken to the skies again. He, like his U.S. and Chinook compatriots, still has much work left to do before the night is over. '}, page_content='\"It is a great opportunity for us to learn from the Canadians. I think they are happy we are here to help support this exercise,\" Barlow remarks. \"The mission ... certainly stands out in my mind. It was complex, it was exciting, and it was a lot of fun to do.\" Troops approach the birds and begin stepping through the slide doors of Barlow\\'s Black Hawk. The transition is busy but orderly. Soon reports come in Canadian Chinooks are also inbound, and suddenly CFB Cold Lake starts to feel a bit crowded. Regardless, Petersen surveys the scene with no signs of distress visible on his face. \"The most difficult part of this operation has actually been the planning,\" the major says. \"This operation encompassed a parachute assault, a tactical air landing operation, as well as an air assault by aviation elements from two different nations - all within the span of 12 hours.\" Coincidentally Barlow would later comment on the planning of tonight\\'s operation too. \"The Canadians seem to be pretty squared away. They show up to do business,\" he said. \"I\\'ve been really impressed with their flight planning process - how they meticulously plan the missions.\" The last infantryman quickly hops aboard as the crew chief slides the door shut behind him. With the Black Hawks full, Barlow and crew take off with their Canadian cargo. \"I hope the junior Soldiers will understand how versatile working with the [Canadian] Air Force or U.S. Army aviation makes them,\" Petersen says. \"We have a lot of coalition assets because that is the way all of our operations have been for the last 15 to 20 years.\" It is calm for a moment after the U.S. birds disappear. The pause is short-lived, however, by the approach of Canadian Chinooks. The brawny twin-engine helicopters waste no time landing in front of the next wave of troops. The Chinook is the helicopter equivalent of a tank. It is a massive flying machine weighing roughly 12 tons and capable of speeds over 190 mph.

Troops out of barracks, field hospitals The renewed Russian military activity in the south must be seen in the broader context of Russian troop movement along the border with eastern Ukraine, according to Grant. \"Until now, satellite images have shown divisions stationed in barracks. Now, some of these soldiers have started to move towards the border. This does not necessarily mean that an attack is imminent, but these soldiers cannot remain on the road indefinitely without doing anything,\" said the expert on Russian military issues. The satellite photos also show, for the first time, \"the installation of a field hospital, which is also a way to intensify the pressure\", added Tracey German, a specialist in Russian military operations at King\\'s College London, in an interview with FRANCE 24. The presence of a field hospital indicates that Russia is considering the possibility of fighting and the need to take care of the wounded on the battlefield. Troops have also been sent to reinforce the garrison at the Kursk training camp in Russia. The presence of Russian armed forces, and in particular armoured vehicles, at this location has worried observers since late December 2021. This camp is directly north of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, which has a large Russian speaking population. \"There is, in fact, a highway that leads from Kursk to Kharkiv, which can facilitate logistical and supply issues,\" explained German. '}, page_content='Satellite images show Russia adding military pressure on Ukraine Moscow this week significantly increased its military presence at several strategic locations along the Ukrainian border, according to satellite images released Thursday. The question now, is how can this military buildup be interpreted and what are the stakes for Ukraine and NATO? Satellite images released by a US-based space technology company on Thursday underscore the increasingly urgent warnings by the US and its allies urging their citizens over the weekend to leave Ukraine immediately in the face of an “imminent” threat of a Russian invasion. \"These images show either the biggest bluff in modern military history or an expression of Russia’s desire to show the world that they are preparing a military operation,\" said Glen Grant, a senior expert at the Baltic Security Foundation, in an interview with FRANCE 24. The satellite images taken on Wednesday and Thursday by Maxar, a Colorado-based space technology company, show deployments of additional troops and military equipment in three areas surrounding Ukraine: Crimea in the south, around the Russian training camp of Kursk near eastern Ukraine, and in Belarus to Ukraine’s north. The biggest deployment of Russian troops was in Crimea, the strategic peninsula that was annexed by Russia in 2014. The new images show several hundred troop deployments, at least 500 tents and military vehicles north of the Crimean capital, Simferopol. Armored vehicles have also arrived in northern Crimea, near the coastal town of Slavne. These military deployments came as several warships – including amphibious assault ships – recently arrived in the Black Sea. \"It may be another way to put pressure on Kyiv, but bringing these warships south is expensive, and having them arrive at the same time as new troops deployments in Crimea shows a willingness to be ready to act, if necessary,\" said Grant.

Last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Kyiv and announced another $500 million in military aid, along with donations of 288 AIM-7 missiles and 10,000 rounds of ammunition. That is on top of donations from the Canadian Armed Forces inventory of dozens of air defence missiles; eight Leopard 2 tanks and ammunition; an armoured recovery vehicle; four M777 howitzers and 33,000 rounds of associated ammunition; 100 Carl Gustaf M2 rifles plus accessories; 4,200 rocket launchers; and 1,800 rounds of tank training ammunition. Canada has also donated winter clothing and other personal protective equipment, 640,000 meal packs and more than $10 million worth of small arms including sniper rifles, machine guns, pistols, anti-tank rockets and carbines. Much more equipment has been procured directly — and quickly — for Ukrainian forces, bypassing Canada\\'s usual procurement process. David Perry, president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute, said that\\'s necessary, but he wonders when the government will put more emphasis on replacing what\\'s been sent to Ukraine. \"If I were wearing a Canadian Army uniform, I would be noticing that we have been equipping the Ukrainian army, in a matter of months in some cases, with pieces of equipment the Canadian Army has been waiting years or decades for,\" he said. Perry said Canada\\'s typical procurement process is elaborate, in contrast with what the government has done to buy equipment for Ukraine, which is \"basically just going out and window-shopping in a hurry.\" While she stressed that the Latvian deployment is not a donation, Anand acknowledged Friday that Canada\\'s efforts to support Ukraine do put a strain on the Armed Forces\\' resources. '}, page_content='OTTAWA - The Canadian Armed Forces will deploy 15 Leopard 2 battle tanks and about 131 personnel to a NATO force in Latvia by next spring, Defence Minister Anita Anand said Friday. Anand made the announcement from Brussels, where she was meeting with defence ministers from countries that support Ukraine\\'s efforts to fight Russia\\'s invasion. The tanks and support vehicles will come from Gagetown, N.B., and Edmonton. \"There will be 15 Leopard 2 A4M tanks, two armoured recovery vehicles and then a variety of maintenance and fuel and supply and transport vehicles,\" Anand said, adding the deployment will consist of a total of 50 vehicles, including the tanks. The Leopard 2 A4M is one of Canada\\'s main battle tanks. They have been deployed in Afghanistan in the past and have mine-clearing capabilities. It\\'s expected that the equipment will arrive in Latvia by the fall, with the full group of personnel in place by next spring. Canada already leads a 10-country NATO battlegroup in Latvia with about 700 Canadian troops. \"We are continually deploying resources there as part of our role as the framework nation of the enhanced forward presence battle group on NATO\\'s eastern flank,\" Anand said. The military alliance has battle groups in Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia in response to Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine. Members agreed at the 2022 summit in Brussels to a new model that will involve more high-readiness troops and brigade-size formations in the area. At the time, Anand announced that she had signed a deal with Latvia to scale up the 2,000-person battle group to a deployment-ready brigade of about 4,000 troops. The details of those contributions have not been finalized, more than a year later. Canada aims to buy and deploy anti-tank weapons, counter-drone and air defence systems, ammunition and explosives as part of its commitment, but with the Armed Forces facing a severe personnel shortage, it remains unclear how many additional troops it can commit.

The media outlet says some 4,000 armed men are being trained in Jordan in the Al-Tanf area, along the Syrian border. Al Mayadeen also reported that Jordanians were assembling heavy artillery and US-made \"Hermas\" missile launchers, purportedly to enter Syria, with air cover and land securing with backup from the US Air Force and Dutch and Bahraini planes.

Meanwhile Syria is on the alert after intelligence reports gathered from surveillance drones suggested that the US, Britain and Jordanian are set to launch a massive invasion on the country. These reports came after Jordan and the US kicked off war drills on Sunday known as Eager Lion with about 7,400 troops from more than 20 nations taking part. Jordanian and American officials say the military drills which include aspects of border security, cyber-defense, and \"command and control\" exercises are meant to bolster coordination in response to threats including \"terrorism\". A statement by the Jordanian army said troops from Europe, Asia, Africa and the Persian Gulf region are taking part in the exercises, which run until May 18, including from Britain, Japan, Kenya and Saudi Arabia.

While trends demonstrate a shift towards increased interstate competition, non-state actors will continue to play an important role in current and future conflicts. Violent extremism and international crime will continue to threaten populations and erode stability.7 State and non-state actors can also work in unison to gain plausible deniability, augment or diversify power projection, or garner greater resources.8 The probability of conflict is enlarged by increasingly adverse national conditions. Climate change remains a pervasive threat, one that modifies the operational environment for the Canadian Army. Internationally, it moves and intensifies the factors noted earlier, affecting existing flashpoints or creating new ones. It also generates demand for humanitarian and disaster relief interventions abroad. Domestically, the frequency of Operation LENTUS deployments to assist civilian authorities has significantly risen in past years, putting pressure on the Canadian Army’s readiness and resources. Climate change is directly affecting how the Canadian Army trains for and executes its missions. It can expect continued impacts on readiness, sustainment, and force employment activities. The effects of climate change are perhaps most pronounced in the Arctic. Rising activity levels in Canada’s Arctic by state and commercial actors raise the potential for safety and security-related challenges. These include search and rescue operations, response to natural or man-made disasters, and response to actions by states with interests in the Arctic. The Canadian Army must be ready to assist in addressing those challenges through exercises, cooperation with domestic partners, and by providing a physical presence when needed. The Canadian Arctic is an unforgiving environment, and deploying and sustaining troops there may require adjustments in the Canadian Army’s structure.9 ', 'context_after': 'Security force capacity building in Operations UNIFIER, IMPACT,10 NABERIUS11 and others is increasingly common and underpinned by Canadian Army soldiers’ proficiency and reputation. The Canadian Army also supports GC objectives through army-to-army relationships that produce operational and tactical benefits and support strategic priorities. States that fail to adapt their use of land forces to the contemporary operating environment will come second place to more innovative and creative competitors.12 Domestically, positive social changes on numerous fronts are driving the CAF to reflect deeply, and to embrace and promote diversity within its ranks. The importance of adopting appropriate recruitment, retention, integration, inclusion, personnel management, and welfare policies is vital to the Canadian Army. It will continue to contribute to CAF diversity targets and eliminate unacceptable behaviours related to harassment or hateful conduct. The expectations of Canadians for members in uniform have always been higher than for most, if not all, other Canadian institutions. This is necessary as the CAF is the only one that legally applies disciplined violence on behalf of the state. While the Canadian Army will continue to promote diversity for moral and ethical reasons, it recognizes that diversity is also a force multiplier for organizations as it varies patterns of thinking and creates operational opportunities in theatres of various demographic profiles. In addition to societal expectations related to social priorities, there is an ever-greater requirement and appreciation for CAF and Canadian Army assistance during domestic crises. The rising frequency of Operation LENTUS deployments has already been noted above. The Canadian Army’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as part of Operation LASER,13 is a reminder that armies have to be ready to provide expertise not only to address pandemics—which are likely to remain an extant challenge—but also other crises. '}, page_content='Other challenges and threats to national and continental defence are surfacing. New missile and long-range capabilities—to include cyber—imply that Canada can no longer assume geographically-assured safety. The current defence policy, SSE, makes the defence of Canada and North America a core mission for the CAF but leaves considerable policy development space to adapt to the changing context. The Canadian Army will look to play a primary role in any continental defence approach that the Government of Canada (GC) might adopt in the future. While other domains of warfare provide advantages, land power remains the most decisive component in winning conflicts in the land domain. Populations reside in the land domain, and thus land forces are key to engaging with and protecting them through physical presence. Moreover, the employment of land forces is a tangible expression of national commitment for international partners—it indicates that a country has “skin in the game.” In all deployments, our land forces, through physical presence, contribute significantly to the grass roots perception of our nation around the world, adding to its ‘soft power.’ The perception of our professionalism, proficiency, and adherence to values is one of the nation’s strongest ambassadors. The information domain is now central to modern conflict, and land forces can increasingly expect to be called upon to create an effect in it. Operation REASSURANCE, for example, is in part an information operation executed in the land domain through its creation of deterrence and reassurance effects. Indeed, while a persistent physical presence is arguably the most effective deterrent against predatory adversaries, even the demonstration of expeditionary warfighting capabilities achieves a deterrent effect causing potential adversaries to change their decision calculus. The Canadian Army will increasingly operate across a variety of mission sets, once considered non-traditional, to achieve GC objectives.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed the news while giving his daily briefing to reporters from Rideau Cottage, acknowledging that conversations are taking place. “Canada and the United States have the longest unmilitarized border in the world and it is very much in both of our interests for it to remain that way,” he said. “We have been in discussions with the United States on this.” Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland also weighed in during a briefing shortly afterwards with reporters, saying that Canadian cabinet ministers and diplomats have been working to try to make it clear to the Americans that this is not a plan Canada supports. “Canada is strongly opposed to this U.S. proposal and we’ve made that very clear to our U.S. counterparts,” she said, noting Canadian officials first learned of the proposal “a couple of days ago.” “We are very directly and very forcefully expressing the view I shared a moment ago, which is that in Canada’s view, this is an entirely unnecessary step which we will view as damaging to our relationship.” Global News has asked the White House to comment on this story but has not received a response. Trump was asked about this proposal during his COVID-19 task force daily briefing. “We have very strong deployments on the southern border, as you know, Mexico, and we have some troops up in Canada, but I’ll find out about that,” he said.

The highways were marked with Red Ball priority signs and were reserved for urgent supplies. (Photo courtesy of the U.S. Army) As a result of learning from the successes and failures of the Red Ball Express, Army planners initiated several changes before the XYZ Express drove into Germany. One of the most significant improvements was the decision to attach veteran transportation divisions to each Army, thereby providing continuous and responsive support. The XYZ Express proved so successful that it became the sustainment standard for future operations. Today’s sustainers must prepare to meet similar challenges to those experienced on the Red Ball Express. As the Army continues to transition away from persistent, limited-contingency operations and prepares for the potential for large-scale combat, it is imperative that the sustainment community recognizes and trains for the demands this will place on the transportation and distribution network. Planners must conduct detailed analysis and careful force tailoring to ensure the appropriate mix of enablers are available to facilitate integrated and responsive sustainment. Leaders must build adaptable organizations capable of improvising to account for both immature theaters and the degraded infrastructure commonly associated with large-scale combat. Embracing these realities and preparing for them will yield a decided advantage to Army sustainers on the twenty-first-century battlefield. 1 Gordon Harrison, The European Theater of Operations: Cross-Channel Attack (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office [GPO], 1951; repr., 1989), 19. 2 See General Board, Motor Transport Service as a Permanent Part of the Transportation Corps (Frankfurt, Germany: Headquarters, U.S. Forces, European Theater, 1945), 3.

Some studies were not synthesised because the participants in the study were identical to those in another included study, and examined the same outcome construct. For example 9 studies were not in included in the synthesis sample because they all used an identical sample of participants from the Millennium Cohort Study (Ryan et al., 2007) and measured the same outcome. In such a case only one study was included in the synthesis sample to avoid double counting of participants. The second reason for studies not being synthesised was due to insufficient information to calculate an effect size. For example several studies provided an adjusted mean difference between treatment and control, but did not provide any raw standard deviation, or other statistics that would permit us to construct an effect size. The third reason for studies not being synthesised was receiving a score of 5 on any item in the risk of bias assessment. Studies that were scored with a 5 on some risk of bias item were included in a sensitivity analysis (where applicable). Table 4.

One study did not report which country troops were deployed from. Most studies (88%) considered deployment to war zones. The remaining studies (9%) considered deployment to civil conflict zones. Twenty studies did not report on the type of deployment. 62% of deployed participants was army personnel.
