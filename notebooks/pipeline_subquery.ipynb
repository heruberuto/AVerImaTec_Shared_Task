Wars of the future will continue to involve the collaboration of multiple nations - no one fights alone anymore. A key element in this joint exercise is the exchange of aviation assets. This particular night has Canadian piloted CH-47 Chinooks and U.S. manned UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. They will be working together to transport Canadian infantryman from CFB Cold Lake to attack nearby objectives. At these sites the Canadians will fight the opposing force - played by the British military. Outside a massive jet hangar stands an equally large man named Maj. Cole Petersen. An infantryman hailing from Cornell, British Columbia, he is the Deputy Commanding Officer for the 3rd Battalion Princess Patricia\\'s Canadian Light Infantry. It is a versatile combat unit dating back to World War I, and has the capability of conducting both airborne and mountain operations. Petersen watches his men on the flight line prepare for the arrival of helicopters. \"We wish to demonstrate the ability to rapidly project force across long distances through the use of air power,\" he explains. \"It is very much a team effort between the infantry and the aviators to project that force.\" Before long the rumble of other aircraft approach the runway. In response, the brute pivots around to face his intruders. A pack of three Black Hawk helicopters swoop in and reveal themselves. They are American friends. When they set down on the tarmac their crew chiefs step out of the mechanical birds and signal to the Canadians it is time to go fight. Among these aviators is U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer 3 Joel N. Barlow of Company A, 1st Battalion, 168th Aviation Regiment. He and his crew are a long way from their home in Boise, Idaho, but seem to be enjoying the mission and thrill of flying outside the U.S. ', 'context_after': 'They have operated in almost every environment imaginable, from the deserts in Iraq to the frozen fields of Antarctica. But most important of all is their ability to carry anywhere from 30 to 50 troops over 1,400 miles one-way. When heavy lifting is needed, the Army calls in Chinooks. Yet even the toughest workhorse has its bad nights. The Chinooks receive the last remaining troops and raise their ramps. After the aircraft begin to leave CFB Cold Lake it soon becomes apparent something is wrong. Radio communication reveals one of the helicopters in the formation has an engine failure. It decides to return. Despite a full load of troops inside, limited visibility, and one engine, the pilot skillfully sets the bird down safely. \"That guy ... just landed a Chinook with one engine ...\" an awed onlooker remarks. The men of C Company march off the wounded Chinook and move inside the hangar. Perhaps disappointed they are not with their comrades, the troops are no doubt thankful they made it to the ground in one piece. Meanwhile, kilometers away, a battle begins to rage. The mission could still go forward despite the setback, Petersen later explained. \"We plan ahead for these sort of things.\" In the midst of the excitement something went missing. The large grey brute is now gone. Taken to the skies again. He, like his U.S. and Chinook compatriots, still has much work left to do before the night is over. '}, page_content='\"It is a great opportunity for us to learn from the Canadians. I think they are happy we are here to help support this exercise,\" Barlow remarks. \"The mission ... certainly stands out in my mind. It was complex, it was exciting, and it was a lot of fun to do.\" Troops approach the birds and begin stepping through the slide doors of Barlow\\'s Black Hawk. The transition is busy but orderly. Soon reports come in Canadian Chinooks are also inbound, and suddenly CFB Cold Lake starts to feel a bit crowded. Regardless, Petersen surveys the scene with no signs of distress visible on his face. \"The most difficult part of this operation has actually been the planning,\" the major says. \"This operation encompassed a parachute assault, a tactical air landing operation, as well as an air assault by aviation elements from two different nations - all within the span of 12 hours.\" Coincidentally Barlow would later comment on the planning of tonight\\'s operation too. \"The Canadians seem to be pretty squared away. They show up to do business,\" he said. \"I\\'ve been really impressed with their flight planning process - how they meticulously plan the missions.\" The last infantryman quickly hops aboard as the crew chief slides the door shut behind him. With the Black Hawks full, Barlow and crew take off with their Canadian cargo. \"I hope the junior Soldiers will understand how versatile working with the [Canadian] Air Force or U.S. Army aviation makes them,\" Petersen says. \"We have a lot of coalition assets because that is the way all of our operations have been for the last 15 to 20 years.\" It is calm for a moment after the U.S. birds disappear. The pause is short-lived, however, by the approach of Canadian Chinooks. The brawny twin-engine helicopters waste no time landing in front of the next wave of troops. The Chinook is the helicopter equivalent of a tank. It is a massive flying machine weighing roughly 12 tons and capable of speeds over 190 mph.

Last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Kyiv and announced another $500 million in military aid, along with donations of 288 AIM-7 missiles and 10,000 rounds of ammunition. That is on top of donations from the Canadian Armed Forces inventory of dozens of air defence missiles; eight Leopard 2 tanks and ammunition; an armoured recovery vehicle; four M777 howitzers and 33,000 rounds of associated ammunition; 100 Carl Gustaf M2 rifles plus accessories; 4,200 rocket launchers; and 1,800 rounds of tank training ammunition. Canada has also donated winter clothing and other personal protective equipment, 640,000 meal packs and more than $10 million worth of small arms including sniper rifles, machine guns, pistols, anti-tank rockets and carbines. Much more equipment has been procured directly — and quickly — for Ukrainian forces, bypassing Canada\\'s usual procurement process. David Perry, president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute, said that\\'s necessary, but he wonders when the government will put more emphasis on replacing what\\'s been sent to Ukraine. \"If I were wearing a Canadian Army uniform, I would be noticing that we have been equipping the Ukrainian army, in a matter of months in some cases, with pieces of equipment the Canadian Army has been waiting years or decades for,\" he said. Perry said Canada\\'s typical procurement process is elaborate, in contrast with what the government has done to buy equipment for Ukraine, which is \"basically just going out and window-shopping in a hurry.\" While she stressed that the Latvian deployment is not a donation, Anand acknowledged Friday that Canada\\'s efforts to support Ukraine do put a strain on the Armed Forces\\' resources. '}, page_content='OTTAWA - The Canadian Armed Forces will deploy 15 Leopard 2 battle tanks and about 131 personnel to a NATO force in Latvia by next spring, Defence Minister Anita Anand said Friday. Anand made the announcement from Brussels, where she was meeting with defence ministers from countries that support Ukraine\\'s efforts to fight Russia\\'s invasion. The tanks and support vehicles will come from Gagetown, N.B., and Edmonton. \"There will be 15 Leopard 2 A4M tanks, two armoured recovery vehicles and then a variety of maintenance and fuel and supply and transport vehicles,\" Anand said, adding the deployment will consist of a total of 50 vehicles, including the tanks. The Leopard 2 A4M is one of Canada\\'s main battle tanks. They have been deployed in Afghanistan in the past and have mine-clearing capabilities. It\\'s expected that the equipment will arrive in Latvia by the fall, with the full group of personnel in place by next spring. Canada already leads a 10-country NATO battlegroup in Latvia with about 700 Canadian troops. \"We are continually deploying resources there as part of our role as the framework nation of the enhanced forward presence battle group on NATO\\'s eastern flank,\" Anand said. The military alliance has battle groups in Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia in response to Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine. Members agreed at the 2022 summit in Brussels to a new model that will involve more high-readiness troops and brigade-size formations in the area. At the time, Anand announced that she had signed a deal with Latvia to scale up the 2,000-person battle group to a deployment-ready brigade of about 4,000 troops. The details of those contributions have not been finalized, more than a year later. Canada aims to buy and deploy anti-tank weapons, counter-drone and air defence systems, ammunition and explosives as part of its commitment, but with the Armed Forces facing a severe personnel shortage, it remains unclear how many additional troops it can commit.

These reports came after Jordan and the US kicked off war drills on Sunday known as Eager Lion with about 7,400 troops from more than 20 nations taking part. Jordanian and American officials say the military drills which include aspects of border security, cyber-defense, and \"command and control\" exercises are meant to bolster coordination in response to threats including \"terrorism\".

While trends demonstrate a shift towards increased interstate competition, non-state actors will continue to play an important role in current and future conflicts. Violent extremism and international crime will continue to threaten populations and erode stability.7 State and non-state actors can also work in unison to gain plausible deniability, augment or diversify power projection, or garner greater resources.8 The probability of conflict is enlarged by increasingly adverse national conditions. Climate change remains a pervasive threat, one that modifies the operational environment for the Canadian Army. Internationally, it moves and intensifies the factors noted earlier, affecting existing flashpoints or creating new ones. It also generates demand for humanitarian and disaster relief interventions abroad. Domestically, the frequency of Operation LENTUS deployments to assist civilian authorities has significantly risen in past years, putting pressure on the Canadian Army’s readiness and resources. Climate change is directly affecting how the Canadian Army trains for and executes its missions. It can expect continued impacts on readiness, sustainment, and force employment activities. The effects of climate change are perhaps most pronounced in the Arctic. Rising activity levels in Canada’s Arctic by state and commercial actors raise the potential for safety and security-related challenges. These include search and rescue operations, response to natural or man-made disasters, and response to actions by states with interests in the Arctic. The Canadian Army must be ready to assist in addressing those challenges through exercises, cooperation with domestic partners, and by providing a physical presence when needed. The Canadian Arctic is an unforgiving environment, and deploying and sustaining troops there may require adjustments in the Canadian Army’s structure.9 ', 'context_after': 'Security force capacity building in Operations UNIFIER, IMPACT,10 NABERIUS11 and others is increasingly common and underpinned by Canadian Army soldiers’ proficiency and reputation. The Canadian Army also supports GC objectives through army-to-army relationships that produce operational and tactical benefits and support strategic priorities. States that fail to adapt their use of land forces to the contemporary operating environment will come second place to more innovative and creative competitors.12 Domestically, positive social changes on numerous fronts are driving the CAF to reflect deeply, and to embrace and promote diversity within its ranks. The importance of adopting appropriate recruitment, retention, integration, inclusion, personnel management, and welfare policies is vital to the Canadian Army. It will continue to contribute to CAF diversity targets and eliminate unacceptable behaviours related to harassment or hateful conduct. The expectations of Canadians for members in uniform have always been higher than for most, if not all, other Canadian institutions. This is necessary as the CAF is the only one that legally applies disciplined violence on behalf of the state. While the Canadian Army will continue to promote diversity for moral and ethical reasons, it recognizes that diversity is also a force multiplier for organizations as it varies patterns of thinking and creates operational opportunities in theatres of various demographic profiles. In addition to societal expectations related to social priorities, there is an ever-greater requirement and appreciation for CAF and Canadian Army assistance during domestic crises. The rising frequency of Operation LENTUS deployments has already been noted above. The Canadian Army’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as part of Operation LASER,13 is a reminder that armies have to be ready to provide expertise not only to address pandemics—which are likely to remain an extant challenge—but also other crises. '}, page_content='Other challenges and threats to national and continental defence are surfacing. New missile and long-range capabilities—to include cyber—imply that Canada can no longer assume geographically-assured safety. The current defence policy, SSE, makes the defence of Canada and North America a core mission for the CAF but leaves considerable policy development space to adapt to the changing context. The Canadian Army will look to play a primary role in any continental defence approach that the Government of Canada (GC) might adopt in the future. While other domains of warfare provide advantages, land power remains the most decisive component in winning conflicts in the land domain. Populations reside in the land domain, and thus land forces are key to engaging with and protecting them through physical presence. Moreover, the employment of land forces is a tangible expression of national commitment for international partners—it indicates that a country has “skin in the game.” In all deployments, our land forces, through physical presence, contribute significantly to the grass roots perception of our nation around the world, adding to its ‘soft power.’ The perception of our professionalism, proficiency, and adherence to values is one of the nation’s strongest ambassadors. The information domain is now central to modern conflict, and land forces can increasingly expect to be called upon to create an effect in it. Operation REASSURANCE, for example, is in part an information operation executed in the land domain through its creation of deterrence and reassurance effects. Indeed, while a persistent physical presence is arguably the most effective deterrent against predatory adversaries, even the demonstration of expeditionary warfighting capabilities achieves a deterrent effect causing potential adversaries to change their decision calculus. The Canadian Army will increasingly operate across a variety of mission sets, once considered non-traditional, to achieve GC objectives.

The base is at Yelnya, southeast of the city of Smolensk and some 160 miles from the Ukrainian border. Large amounts of weaponry were moved there late in 2021 – including some 700 tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and ballistic missile launchers. Much of that equipment is now gone, according to radar satellite imagery acquired on February 6. Cloud cover had prevented photographic imagery of the site for several days previously. The images show the tracks of departing vehicles. Stephen Wood, senior director at satellite imagery company Maxar, told CNN: “It looks to me like a considerable amount of the vehicles [tanks, self-propelled artillery and other support vehicles] have departed from the northeastern vehicle park; additional armored vehicles departed from the more central vehicle park.” ‘Entering the new stage of the build-up’ Konrad Muzyka, an expert in tracking military movements with Rochan Consulting, says what has happened at Yelnya is one of several “important changes in Russian force compositions and their locations.” He told CNN: “We are entering the new stage of the build-up where we are seeing pre-positioned units being manned with additional personnel and that equipment is being moved probably to staging areas.” Social media videos shot in the last few days show some of that equipment on trains and roads much further south in the Bryansk region, which is close to Ukraine. The armor and vehicles are identifiably from the same units that had pre-positioned at Yelnya. ', 'context_after': 'Muzyka says there are substantial Russian movements elsewhere. “We are seeing a massive influx of vehicles and personnel in Kursk,” he tweeted Sunday. Kursk is some 70 miles (100 kilometers) from the border with Ukraine. Phillip Karber of the Potomac Foundation in Washington, who has also studied Russian troop movements in detail, told CNN: “Russia’s strongest offensive formation – the First Guards Tank Army, which is normally stationed in the Moscow area – has moved south 400 kilometers and is assembling in the optimum area for a rapid armored offensive on the Khursk-Kyiv invasion route.” On Sunday, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told ABC News: “We believe that there is a very distinct possibility that Vladimir Putin will order an attack on Ukraine. It could take a number of different forms. It could happen as soon as tomorrow or it could take some weeks yet.” Separately US officials told CNN at the weekend that Russian President Vladimir Putin has now assembled 70% of the military personnel and weapons on Ukraine’s borders he would need for a full-scale invasion of the country. This includes a growing force in southern Belarus. '}, page_content='“We know that Yelnya hosts elements of the 41st army of the CMD [Russia’s Central Military District] that arrived from Siberia last spring to a training ground near Voronezh and whose vehicles were later moved to Yelnya,” Russian journalist Rusland Leviev of the Conflict Investigation Team (CIT), a Russian open-source intelligence group, told CNN. Social media videos around Bryansk show military vehicles with “76” and “87” codes on their number plates which denote the CMD, he pointed out. Leviev added that the CIT believes the vehicles are moving to Bryansk, “because we saw two videos of the same convoy in Smolensk region and then in Bryansk region to the south,” which the group geolocated against crowdsourced dashcam footage and satellite imagery. “We also saw videos of several trains that were posted by social media users from Bryansk region. On the carriages we could read 8-digit identification codes, which, when checked against openly accessible databases, trace the train’s origins to Yelnya.” “This is important because those vehicles previously were several hundred kilometers away from the border, and now [they] are stopping in mere dozens [of kilometers away].” Thomas Bullock, an analyst at Janes, wrote: “There are now multiple indicators suggesting troops have begun deploying to forward camps to join up with their prepositioned equipment.” He also added that videos posted on social media indicate that troops from Siberia, whose equipment has already been moved to sites in Smolensk and Bryansk, are in the process of deploying. A US intelligence document dated December 3, 2021 included satellite imagery showing that the site at Yelnya was empty in June – but by November was home to five Battalion Tactical Groups, each of which contains about 1,000 troops and supporting elements. Much of the equipment belongs to the 41st Combined Arms Army, which is normally based in Russia’s CMD and has its headquarters in Novosibirsk in Siberia.

Some studies were not synthesised because the participants in the study were identical to those in another included study, and examined the same outcome construct.

In such a case only one study was included in the synthesis sample to avoid double counting of participants. The second reason for studies not being synthesised was due to insufficient information to calculate an effect size. For example several studies provided an adjusted mean difference between treatment and control, but did not provide any raw standard deviation, or other statistics that would permit us to construct an effect size. The third reason for studies not being synthesised was receiving a score of 5 on any item in the risk of bias assessment.

Other deploying countries in the sample were Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Kuwait, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka (total of 28studies). One study did not report which country troops were deployed from. Most studies (88%) considered deployment to war zones. The remaining studies (9%) considered deployment to civil conflict zones. Twenty studies did not report on the type of deployment. 62% of deployed participants was army personnel. A smaller share of deployed participants was personnel of other military branches: Navy (14%), Air Force (15%), and Marines (9%). 70 studies did not report on the service branch of participants. At the study level 83% of the participants were males (30studies did not report on gender composition). Participants were 69% white Caucasian at the study level (not reported in 89studies), had an average age of 32 years (not reported in 52studies), and 56% were married (not reported in 72studies). At the study level 30% of participants had previously been deployed (not reported in 141 studies). 54% of the deployed participants were from the Active Component (regulars). The remaining share of participants consisted either of members from the Reserve Component (reserves) or members of the National Guard (not reported in 67 studies). Finally, 84% of the participants (at the study level) were enlisted personnel (not reported in 77studies). 4.1.2.1 Study characteristics: synthesis sample Table 1 presents study characteristics for all included studies. Table 4 presents the study characteristics for those studies where an effect size could be calculated and used in the meta‐analysis. This sample of studies forms the basis for the synthesis. We therefore refer to this sample of studies as the synthesis sample.

North Korea had criticized the drills, calling them a preparation for invasion, although the U.S. and South Korea insist they are defensive in nature.\\n\\nThe North’s declaration Friday is similar to its other warlike rhetoric in recent years, including repeated threats to reduce Seoul to a “sea of fire,” and the huge numbers of soldiers and military equipment already stationed along the border mean the area is always essentially in a “quasi-state of war.” Still, the North’s apparent willingness to test Seoul with military strikes and its recent warning of further action raise worries because South Korea has vowed to hit back with overwhelming strength should North Korea attack again.\\n\\nPyongyang says it did not fire anything at the South, a claim Seoul dismissed as nonsense.\\n\\nKim Jong Un ordered his troops to “enter a wartime state” and be fully ready for any military operations starting Friday evening, according to a report in Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency. The North also has given Seoul a deadline of tonight to remove border loudspeakers that, after a lull of 11 years, have started broadcasting anti-Pyongyang propaganda. Failure, Pyongyang says, will result in further military action. Seoul has vowed to continue the broadcasts.\\n\\nThe North’s media report said “military commanders were urgently dispatched for operations to attack South Korean psychological warfare facilities if the South doesn’t stop operating them.”\\n\\nSouth Korea’s Yonhap news agency, citing an unidentified government source, reported Friday that South Korean and U.S. surveillance assets detected the movement of vehicles carrying short-range Scud and medium-range Rodong missiles in a possible preparation for launches. South Korea’s Defense Ministry said it could not confirm the report.\\n\\nNorth Korea said the South Korean shells fired Thursday landed near four military posts but caused no injuries. No one was reported injured in the South, either, though hundreds were evacuated from front-line towns.\\n\\nThe loudspeaker broadcasts began after South Korea accused the North of planting land mines that maimed two South Korean soldiers this month. North Korea denies this, too.\\n\\nAuthoritarian North Korea, which has restarted its own propaganda broadcasts, is extremely sensitive to any criticism of its government, run by leader Kim Jong Un, whose family has ruled since the North was founded in 1948. The loudspeaker broadcasts are taken seriously in Pyongyang because the government does not want its soldiers and residents to hear outsiders criticize human rights abuses and economic mismanagement that condemns many to abject poverty, South Korean analysts say.\\n\\nMany in Seoul are accustomed to ignoring or discounting North Korea’s repeated threats, but the latest have caused worry because of Pyongyang’s warning of strikes if the South doesn’t tear down its loudspeakers by this evening. Observers say the North may need some save-facing measure to back down.\\n\\nThis is what happened in December 2010, when North Korea backed off an earlier warning of catastrophic retaliation after South Korea defiantly went ahead with live-fire drills near the country’s disputed western sea boundary. A month earlier, when South Korea staged similar drills, the North reacted with an artillery bombardment that killed four people on a South Korean border island. North Korea said it didn’t respond to the second drill because South Korea conducted it in a less provocative way, though the South said both drills were the same.\\n\\n### Share this:\\n\\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/21/north-korea-warns-of-war-with-south/?share=facebook&nb=1)\\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/21/north-korea-warns-of-war-with-south/?share=twitter&nb=1)\\n- [Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Reddit](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/21/north-korea-warns-of-war-with-south/?share=reddit&nb=1)\\n- [Click to print (Opens in new window)Print](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/21/north-korea-warns-of-war-with-south/#print?share=print&n', 'image': '67d0a15035531374f6dae467#CLAIM#2.jpg', 'metadata': {'title': 'North Korea warns of war with South – Orange County Register', 'description': 'PYONGYANG, North Korea – North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Friday declared his front-line troops in a “quasi-state of war” and ordered them to prepare for battle with South Korea a day after the most serious confrontation between the rivals in years.

Every Saturday from now until National Day on 09 Aug 2015 will be used to practice for the parade, including a fly past (next post will include photos of the fly past) and the fireworks display, which, unfortunately, I am not able to see from my balcony.\\n\\n[![SG50 Logo](https://i0.wp.com/ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SG50-Logo-300x300.jpg?resize=300%2C300&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SG50-Logo.jpg?ssl=1)\\n\\nAs this year is the 50th Anniversary of the Independence of Singapore, the National Day Celebrations and Parade will be even bigger than usual. The size of the parade and (probably) the fireworks will dwarf the previous years. This year the National Day Celebration will be held at the Padang with Nicholl Highway being used as the staging area for the vehicles that will showcase Singapore’s Military and Civil Defence capabilities.

North Korea had criticized the drills, calling them a preparation for invasion, although the U.S. and South Korea insist they are defensive in nature.\\n\\nThe North’s declaration Friday is similar to its other warlike rhetoric in recent years, including repeated threats to reduce Seoul to a “sea of fire,” and the huge numbers of soldiers and military equipment already stationed along the border mean the area is always essentially in a “quasi-state of war.” Still, the North’s apparent willingness to test Seoul with military strikes and its recent warning of further action raise worries because South Korea has vowed to hit back with overwhelming strength should North Korea attack again.\\n\\nPyongyang says it did not fire anything at the South, a claim Seoul dismissed as nonsense.\\n\\nKim Jong Un ordered his troops to “enter a wartime state” and be fully ready for any military operations starting Friday evening, according to a report in Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency. The North also has given Seoul a deadline of tonight to remove border loudspeakers that, after a lull of 11 years, have started broadcasting anti-Pyongyang propaganda. Failure, Pyongyang says, will result in further military action. Seoul has vowed to continue the broadcasts.\\n\\nThe North’s media report said “military commanders were urgently dispatched for operations to attack South Korean psychological warfare facilities if the South doesn’t stop operating them.”\\n\\nSouth Korea’s Yonhap news agency, citing an unidentified government source, reported Friday that South Korean and U.S. surveillance assets detected the movement of vehicles carrying short-range Scud and medium-range Rodong missiles in a possible preparation for launches. South Korea’s Defense Ministry said it could not confirm the report.\\n\\nNorth Korea said the South Korean shells fired Thursday landed near four military posts but caused no injuries. No one was reported injured in the South, either, though hundreds were evacuated from front-line towns.\\n\\nThe loudspeaker broadcasts began after South Korea accused the North of planting land mines that maimed two South Korean soldiers this month. North Korea denies this, too.\\n\\nAuthoritarian North Korea, which has restarted its own propaganda broadcasts, is extremely sensitive to any criticism of its government, run by leader Kim Jong Un, whose family has ruled since the North was founded in 1948. The loudspeaker broadcasts are taken seriously in Pyongyang because the government does not want its soldiers and residents to hear outsiders criticize human rights abuses and economic mismanagement that condemns many to abject poverty, South Korean analysts say.\\n\\nMany in Seoul are accustomed to ignoring or discounting North Korea’s repeated threats, but the latest have caused worry because of Pyongyang’s warning of strikes if the South doesn’t tear down its loudspeakers by this evening. Observers say the North may need some save-facing measure to back down.\\n\\nThis is what happened in December 2010, when North Korea backed off an earlier warning of catastrophic retaliation after South Korea defiantly went ahead with live-fire drills near the country’s disputed western sea boundary. A month earlier, when South Korea staged similar drills, the North reacted with an artillery bombardment that killed four people on a South Korean border island. North Korea said it didn’t respond to the second drill because South Korea conducted it in a less provocative way, though the South said both drills were the same.\\n\\n### Share this:\\n\\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/21/north-korea-warns-of-war-with-south/?share=facebook&nb=1)\\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/21/north-korea-warns-of-war-with-south/?share=twitter&nb=1)\\n- [Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Reddit](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/21/north-korea-warns-of-war-with-south/?share=reddit&nb=1)\\n- [Click to print (Opens in new window)Print](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/21/north-korea-warns-of-war-with-south/#print?share=print&n',\n",

The practice started at about 1pm and went through until around 10pm. Every Saturday from now until National Day on 09 Aug 2015 will be used to practice for the parade, including a fly past (next post will include photos of the fly past) and the fireworks display, which, unfortunately, I am not able to see from my balcony.\\n\\n[![SG50 Logo](https://i0.wp.com/ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SG50-Logo-300x300.jpg?resize=300%2C300&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SG50-Logo.jpg?ssl=1)\\n\\nAs this year is the 50th Anniversary of the Independence of Singapore, the National Day Celebrations and Parade will be even bigger than usual. The size of the parade and (probably) the fireworks will dwarf the previous years. This year the National Day Celebration will be held at the Padang with Nicholl Highway being used as the staging area for the vehicles that will showcase Singapore’s Military and Civil Defence capabilities. Nicholl Highway is the road directly below my balcony so I have a fantastic view of the staging area, these are some of the photos I took on 20 Jun 2015.\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01808.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01672.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01659.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01648.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01643.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01636.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01614.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01613.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01612.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01605.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01597.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01583.jpg?fit=640%2C427&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01565.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01554.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01549.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01546.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01533.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01532.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01528.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01523.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01808.jpg?resize=100%2C100&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01672.jpg?resize=100%2C100&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01659.jpg?resize=100%2C100&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Prac',\n",

North Korea had criticized the drills, calling them a preparation for invasion, although the U.S. and South Korea insist they are defensive in nature.\\n\\nThe North’s declaration Friday is similar to its other warlike rhetoric in recent years, including repeated threats to reduce Seoul to a “sea of fire,” and the huge numbers of soldiers and military equipment already stationed along the border mean the area is always essentially in a “quasi-state of war.” Still, the North’s apparent willingness to test Seoul with military strikes and its recent warning of further action raise worries because South Korea has vowed to hit back with overwhelming strength should North Korea attack again.\\n\\nPyongyang says it did not fire anything at the South, a claim Seoul dismissed as nonsense.\\n\\nKim Jong Un ordered his troops to “enter a wartime state” and be fully ready for any military operations starting Friday evening, according to a report in Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency. The North also has given Seoul a deadline of tonight to remove border loudspeakers that, after a lull of 11 years, have started broadcasting anti-Pyongyang propaganda. Failure, Pyongyang says, will result in further military action. Seoul has vowed to continue the broadcasts.\\n\\nThe North’s media report said “military commanders were urgently dispatched for operations to attack South Korean psychological warfare facilities if the South doesn’t stop operating them.”\\n\\nSouth Korea’s Yonhap news agency, citing an unidentified government source, reported Friday that South Korean and U.S. surveillance assets detected the movement of vehicles carrying short-range Scud and medium-range Rodong missiles in a possible preparation for launches. South Korea’s Defense Ministry said it could not confirm the report.\\n\\nNorth Korea said the South Korean shells fired Thursday landed near four military posts but caused no injuries. No one was reported injured in the South, either, though hundreds were evacuated from front-line towns.\\n\\nThe loudspeaker broadcasts began after South Korea accused the North of planting land mines that maimed two South Korean soldiers this month. North Korea denies this, too.\\n\\nAuthoritarian North Korea, which has restarted its own propaganda broadcasts, is extremely sensitive to any criticism of its government, run by leader Kim Jong Un, whose family has ruled since the North was founded in 1948. The loudspeaker broadcasts are taken seriously in Pyongyang because the government does not want its soldiers and residents to hear outsiders criticize human rights abuses and economic mismanagement that condemns many to abject poverty, South Korean analysts say.\\n\\nMany in Seoul are accustomed to ignoring or discounting North Korea’s repeated threats, but the latest have caused worry because of Pyongyang’s warning of strikes if the South doesn’t tear down its loudspeakers by this evening. Observers say the North may need some save-facing measure to back down.\\n\\nThis is what happened in December 2010, when North Korea backed off an earlier warning of catastrophic retaliation after South Korea defiantly went ahead with live-fire drills near the country’s disputed western sea boundary. A month earlier, when South Korea staged similar drills, the North reacted with an artillery bombardment that killed four people on a South Korean border island. North Korea said it didn’t respond to the second drill because South Korea conducted it in a less provocative way, though the South said both drills were the same.\\n\\n### Share this:\\n\\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/21/north-korea-warns-of-war-with-south/?share=facebook&nb=1)\\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/21/north-korea-warns-of-war-with-south/?share=twitter&nb=1)\\n- [Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Reddit](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/21/north-korea-warns-of-war-with-south/?share=reddit&nb=1)\\n- [Click to print (Opens in new window)Print](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/21/north-korea-warns-of-war-with-south/#print?share=print&n',\n",

The practice started at about 1pm and went through until around 10pm. Every Saturday from now until National Day on 09 Aug 2015 will be used to practice for the parade, including a fly past (next post will include photos of the fly past) and the fireworks display, which, unfortunately, I am not able to see from my balcony.\\n\\n[![SG50 Logo](https://i0.wp.com/ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SG50-Logo-300x300.jpg?resize=300%2C300&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SG50-Logo.jpg?ssl=1)\\n\\nAs this year is the 50th Anniversary of the Independence of Singapore, the National Day Celebrations and Parade will be even bigger than usual. The size of the parade and (probably) the fireworks will dwarf the previous years. This year the National Day Celebration will be held at the Padang with Nicholl Highway being used as the staging area for the vehicles that will showcase Singapore’s Military and Civil Defence capabilities. Nicholl Highway is the road directly below my balcony so I have a fantastic view of the staging area, these are some of the photos I took on 20 Jun 2015.\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01808.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01672.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01659.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01648.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01643.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01636.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01614.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01613.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01612.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01605.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01597.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01583.jpg?fit=640%2C427&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01565.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01554.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01549.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01546.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01533.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01532.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01528.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01523.jpg?fit=640%2C480&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01808.jpg?resize=100%2C100&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01672.jpg?resize=100%2C100&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Practice](https://i0.wp.com/www.ozstravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150620-DSC01659.jpg?resize=100%2C100&ssl=1)\\n\\n![SG50 National Day Parade Prac',\n",

There’s a whole Wikipedia page dedicated to it! The family smuggled a vast number of artifacts dating back to Biblical times with the intention of displaying them at the Museum of the Bible in Washington D.C. The artifacts were likely looted from the National Museum of Iraq after America’s invasion of the country in 2003. They were later acquired by dealers from the United Arab Emirates and sold to Hobby Lobby for $1.6 million. Many of these artifacts lacked any evidence for their original ownership, and were possibly acquired through the black market. The shipment of artifacts was seized in New York by customs agents, and the company was fined $3 million dollars and ordered to return all 5,500 of them. Yes, Hobby Lobby smuggled over 5,000 artifacts out of a war-ravaged country in order to give them to a museum, which intended to use those artifacts to prove the veracity of the Bible itself. How’s that for religious freedom? A little too free, if you ask me. To make matters worse, Hobby Lobby was acquiring all of these artifacts in order to donate them and then write off those donations as tax deductions. Essentially, Hobby Lobby’s plan was to be paid by the government to smuggle illegally obtained artifacts out of an active warzone. And like the trials and tribulations of the Biblical Job, it gets worse. In 2020, Hobby Lobby announced that it would be keeping its brick and mortar locations open at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Why? Because David Green claimed that his wife had received a “message from God” that Hobby Lobby’s stores should not be closed. As a result, the company refused to pay sick leave during the pandemic and told managers to “continue working the employees.” The state government later forced Hobby Lobby to close its doors, but they didn’t stay that way for long. ', 'context_after': ''}, page_content='The company reopened its doors illegally in several locations, causing fearful employees to speak out. Hobby Lobby then decided to ignore God’s word and shutter its businesses across the country, but not before furloughing all of its employees, leaving many to wonder if God told them not to pay their employees, too? In September 2020, the company faced a boycott after a “VOTE FOR TRUMP” display appeared in one of its stores. I don’t know who told them to do that, but it sure as hell wasn’t God. It’s ironic that the store would endorse a man who would later pose for a photo while holding the Bible upside down. I suppose in their minds it’s better that he was holding it at all? After all, David Green has gone on record saying that Donald Trump was America’s best choice to maintain “religious freedom.” In an op-ed for USA Today, Green wrote, “Donald Trump has been steadfast in expressing his commitment to uphold the Constitution, and his list of possible Supreme Court nominees inspires confidence that there is hope in my future (…) for a country that will value those most fundamental rights.” Apparently that includes the freedom to loot artifacts from other countries and use them to evangelize people at your fake Bible museum. So if you ever find yourself in need of arts and craft supplies, please find a better store than Hobby Lobby. After all, that construction paper they sold you might actually turn out to be the lost Gospel of Mary Magdalene. That piece of canvas might turn out to be the shroud of Turin. And those big nails they’ve got behind the counter? Those might have nailed down more than just a few birdhouses. With this company, you never can tell.

If you are looking for these.. I’d rush to the store before they’re gone, if they’re not already. So… in reality, these bottle stoppers were pretty cool as is. I love the combination of black & gold…. but I thought I’d give a different spin to one of them, and I painted it with a gloss black spraypaint. That one is my favorite! I know, I know… what a fucking surprise… the darkling likes the black one best!! I paired the stoppers with black wine bottles. To achieve these bottles, I lightly sprayed them with flat black spraypaint repeatedly until they were covered. OK, I’m not suggesting that you paint each bottle of wine that you intend to drink….. I’m fairly confident that these stoppers will look cool in any bottle of wine….. but today I’m bringing you a twofer… that’s right – another great idea…. Do you ever open a bottle of wine, and that last little bit gets forgotten about.. and a few days later you realize it’s gone bad? I know – there really should never be such a thing as left-over wine! But, c’mon.. it happens to the best of us. Do not throw that bad wine away!! Find yourself a cool bottle, and save that wine for cooking! And every time you have that bit of leftover wine…. add it to the bottle. No vegetable should be sauteed without a dash of that wine… and no jar of tomato sauce should be heated without a dash of that wine! I’m Italian and a vegetarian… so I follow these rules A LOT! That old wine will do wonders for your cooking! 🙂 So…. as you might have guessed.. this black matte bottle with the black horned stopper now has permanent residence in my kitchen as my Heavy Metal “Leftover Wine” bottle. Interested in other wine bottle crafts? You have to try this DIY Beaded wine Bottle Cover or these Skull Wine Bottle Stoppers! '}, page_content='Horns, antlers, animal skulls…. all such commonplace figures in decorating these days. And interestingly enough, they seem to fit in so many different decorating styles…. Southwest, Hunting Lodge, Nature…… and the oh so popular Farmhouse. All of which are about as far from my decorating style as humanly possible!! Yet… I find myself intrigued by horns and antlers and animal skulls because every so often I come across one that is cool… and dark… and weird…. Let’s not forget that these things also have a popular place in some darker subcultures like heavy metal music or pagan symbolism… so they certainly fit into a darker aesthetic… if you find the right piece….. OR are creative enough to repurpose! This is a tale of finding a cool pair of horns in a most unexpected place, and turning that pair, which were most certainly meant for those earlier decorating styles I mentioned, into something dark & amazing. So here’s the part I hate to admit…. I found these gold horned wine bottle stoppers at Hobby Lobby. Ugh – I said it. The truth is… I am not a fan of Hobby Lobby…. not because of their products but because of their policies. I do not care what a person’s religious beliefs are, but I am strongly against any person imposing those beliefs onto another, let alone an employer doing so to their employees… therefore I struggle with Hobby Lobby, a Christian Craft Store, known for its involvement with some discriminatory issues. I would like to say that I have boycotted this retail chain… and while I certainly make it a point to buy crafts elsewhere… as a practically professional DIY’er, I do regrettably find myself in their store every once in a while. But that’s what made this little find oh so special…. because you know that Hobby Lobby would shudder at the thought of their wholesome decor being used in this way… and that makes me smile!… insert evil grin. OK.. off of my soapbox, and back to crafts! I found these wine bottle stoppers in the clearance section for less than $3!!

The tablet is 6 inches by 5 inches and is written in Akkadian, an ancient Mesopotamian language.

No company is *required* to offer health care benefits. They choose to do so in order to attract and keep workers. And the way I see it, the healthcare package is part of the employee’s compensation for working there, and the company should have no more to say about what they use the health care plan to pay for than they get to tell the employee how they will spend their paycheck.

Here is my page: samsung galaxy s3 Visit my homepage samsung galaxy s3 HeyYouKidsGetOffMyLawn To speak to another commenter on here: I may not be a devoutly religious person but I have no problem with Hobby Lobby closing on Sundays. I have no issue with Jesus and images of Jesus all around their store. I ****do**** have a problem when they decide to get involved with what goes on inside Miss Boo Boo Kitty, and that’s where I draw the line. This to me is quite similar to Chick-Fil-A and that debate. CFA is most welcome to close on Sundays (in fact, I respect their reasons for it) and they may have, for all I know or care, carolers singing from hymnals inside the store if they so wish. But when MONEY that I spend there is then funneled into something that would potentially hurt me (Hobby Lobby and their lobbyists) or my friends (CFA’s funding of anti-gay causes) then yes, we can (1) speak out about it and (2) stop spending money there. LaurieMann I went to one Hobby Lobby one time, and it was clearly a place trying to push certain religious attitudes. I haven’t been back, and it is clear I wasn’t wrong.

Co-founders Larry and Frances Jones said that the company staged a “hostile takeover” of the organization. The Joneses sued Hobby Lobby for its actions, but the lawsuit was later dropped. Still, who would try to take over a charity? In 2012, the company ran into hot water again after refusing to provide contraceptives to employees, and sued the government of Oklahoma claiming that the state was forcing them to go against their “religious beliefs”. The Supreme Court eventually ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby, resulting in widespread protests across the country. In her dissenting opinion, Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued that the decision to allow Hobby Lobby to deny contraceptive insurance to employees could set a disturbing legal precedent in America, allowing corporations to assert legal rights over individuals. Many feared that the decision would allow corporations to discriminate against non-Christian or queer people based on religious grounds. These fears were not unfounded. After Hobby Lobby’s Supreme Court victory, the company decided to one-up themselves by asking for exemption from an Obama administration policy that banned employers from discriminating against job applicants on the basis of their sexuality. Hobby Lobby once again cited “religious beliefs” as the reason to deny LGBTQ+ employment. Hobby Lobby later proved its own intolerance to religious beliefs when an employee told a Jewish customer that the store “does not cater to your people” when asked about Jewish holiday decorations. Company president David Green later made a formal apology to the Anti-Defamation League, saying that the employee’s comments “do not reflect the feelings of our family or Hobby Lobby.” '}, page_content='A Brief Timeline of Hobby Lobby’s Many Controversies Some controversies I can see coming a mile away: J.K. Rowling just tweeted? Disaster incoming. Others take me by surprise: RuPaul got caught up in a fracking scandal? Where in God’s name did that come from?

At first glance, the company seems entirely wholesome. Oh, look! What a cute little arts and crafts store! Maybe the kindly woman behind the counter can supply me with practical knowledge of how to build a birdhouse! Or maybe how to make tiny hats for each bird that lives inside! After all, what could be more innocent, more guileless, and more hygge-inducing than a company solely dedicated to hobbies. Hobbies are about as sweet and non-threatening as you can get! Bird watching! Homes for dolls! Tinkering around the garage! How could a store dedicated to facilitating little acts of joy possibly be evil? Allow me to rip off your rose-colored glasses, because this story is gonna be a doozy. A hobby … for evildoing Over the course of its 50-year history, Hobby Lobby has been embroiled in dozens of controversies. The arts and crafts store is currently led by CEO David Green and his conservative Christian family, who proclaim that the company’s sole mission is “honoring the Lord” and “operating the company in a manner consistent with Biblical principles.” Do these Biblical principles involve “doing unto others,” “turning the other cheek,” and refraining from “casting stones”? Hardly. The company and its founders are far more interested in the “hate the Jews and the gays” kind of Christian values, and have faced countless claims of antisemitism, homophobia, and failing—nay, refusing—to provide insurance for contraceptives for employees. That last one went all the way to the Supreme Court. So what are some of Hobby Lobby’s most flagrant misdeeds? Let’s take a look-see.
