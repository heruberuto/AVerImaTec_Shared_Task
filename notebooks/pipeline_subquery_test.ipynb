I went out and found two local police constables outside, armed with automatic assault rifles, asking for Shahbaz. I called Shahbaz from his room. They asked him to step outside the house. In the meantime, the local SHO arrived with four more constables in his official vehicle. Upon his arrival, the constables assaulted Shahbaz, kicking and punching him. One of the constables shot him in the right shoulder with a pistol. The SHO then fired his rifle and the bullet went through his abdomen. Our neighbors tried to intervene and bring water for Shahbaz but the police fired shots in the air to scare them away. Shahbaz died on the spot in front of my eyes. There are many other witnesses to his killing.[103] The police registered an FIR regarding Shahbaz’s death before Allah Rakkha could file a complaint himself. According to the police version, two police officers were patrolling the neighborhood on motorcycles on the night of July 12, 2010, when they spotted two individuals on a motorcycle without a license plate. They signaled the two to stop, but they sped away, so the police followed them. The police claimed that Shahbaz fired at them, so they fired in retaliation. According the police, the individual allegedly accompanying Shahbaz left him and the motorcycle at the front door of a house and managed to flee on foot. Police said Shahbaz died before the police could call for medical assistance. Allah Rakha said that after about 18 months of repeated attempts, he managed to get a criminal case registered against the police officers. However, fellow police officers let off the accused constables after their investigation. Allah Rakha then filed a private complaint and is still seeking justice for his son’s killing: “Not only have they killed my son, they have also sullied his name by making it seem that he was a criminal. He was not a criminal.”[104] Killing of Bilal Khan ', 'context_after': 'Prominent examples in recent years of police abuses against public protests include the 2013 crackdown in Faisalabad on citizens protesting against power cuts;[106] a 2014 crackdown in Karachi on teachers protesting the non-payment of salaries;[107] a 2014 crackdown in Lahore against a group of the blind who were demanding an increase in the employment quota;[108] and a 2015 crackdown in the Punjabi towns of Vehari and Okara against farmers who were attempting to march to Islamabad to protest government agriculture policies.[109] In many cases, protesters have accused the police of resorting to unnecessary or excessive force, intimidating family members, including women and children, and framing false charges against protesters as a means of suppressing dissent. Police officials told Human Rights Watch that force is only used in retaliation: that is, when assemblies do not remain peaceful and protesters threaten public order by resorting to violence and rioting. Independent analysts, however, say that the police resort to violence because of lack of training in the principles and practices of crowd management.[110] International human rights law protects the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and association. Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), governments can only impose restrictions on basic liberties that are provided by law; are imposed only for one of the grounds set out in the covenant, such as public order; and that conform to the strict tests of necessity and proportionality. That is, restrictions must be necessary for a legitimate purpose, appropriate to achieve their protective function using the least intrusive method available, and proportionate to the interest being protected.[111] The UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms provide that law enforcement officials shall as far as possible apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force and firearms.

His father, Zubaidullah, who is a resident of Khyber in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), said that he saw Bilal in police custody after being arrested for political reasons. The police later claimed that Bilal was killed while attempting to escape. Zubaidullah told Human Rights Watch: My son, Bilal, was working as an employee of a local political leader in Lahore. I received a call informing me that my son had been arrested by the police and I immediately left for Lahore. When I reached the police station on the morning of April 19, 2014, I saw that my son was handcuffed and lying face down on the floor. The SHO said he was arrested because the police had orders to arrest [his employer] and everyone who was with him at that time. I pleaded with the SHO and told him that we are people from the tribal areas, and have nothing to do with the political rivalries in Lahore. He refused to listen and ordered his staff to throw me out of the police station. In the evening I received a phone call from the police saying that my son was killed while trying to escape. I went to the place he was murdered, along with people from my son’s office. Several people witnessed the murder of my son. [They said] the police handcuffed and blindfolded my son, then took him out of the car and shot him dead on the roadside. The police have registered the case as a self-defense killing, naming my son as a criminal.[105] Infringements of Basic Rights The Pakistani government has frequently made use of the police to crack down on political opponents, crush political dissent, or quell public protests against the government and government policies.

If a hospital does get involved, and the incident of torture goes public, then this becomes problematic. “In such a case, the bifurcation of higher and lower police comes into action. The senior police officials, who had until now turned a blind eye to the rampant practice of torture now crack down on the culprits and may even punish them,” explained Chaudhry. In this case too, the two constables have already been suspended and City Police Officer Azhar Hameed Khokar has also suspended SHO Malik Tahir for not arresting the accused earlier. But, according to Chaudhry, this does not indicate a step in the right direction. “It’s not that the police are not doing anything about torture, it’s that the number of disciplinary measures that are faced by perpetrators of torture do not correspond at all with the reality on ground,” she asserted. A manual on reporting of torture by Individualland and Open Society Foundation relates: “According to statistics, 555 suspects were taken into police custody in 2001, 990 in 2002, 838 in 2003, 1,269 in 2004, 1,350 in 2005 and 1,660 in 2006 were locked up or shifted to private torture cells.” Similar numbers are reported for 2007 (1,725), 2008 (1,100), 2009 (1,560) and 2010 (1,640). And even though Pakistan has ratified the United Nations ‘Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment’ in 2010, nothing has changed on the ground even two years later. “There is a clear method to the entire process of torture in our criminal system, and this is being done since colonial times as far back as the 1800s,” informed Chaudhry. So any eradication of the practice requires a complete overhaul of the system on a legal, structural and logistical level. '}, page_content='ISLAMABAD: “Poorest of the poor and marginalised are the most frequent victims of police torture,” declared Kamran Arif, Co-Chairperson Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, who has been working on creating awareness about non-implementation of the Convention against Torture ratified by Pakistan in 2010. On Sunday, an 18-year-old milkman, Malik Waqqar Ahmad, died after allegedly being beaten by the police in a private torture cell in Pirwadhai before being dumped at Chandni Chawk, Rawalpindi. According to newspapers, the boy was unable to recover from the brutal torture and died at Holy Family Hospital nine days after being admitted. According to news sources, he was able to divulge the police brutality much before losing his life. He said: “I was tied with an iron chain in a room and later hanged from the ceiling. I was beaten with iron rods and subjected to severe torture…” Reportedly, his nails were also pulled out and red chili thrown in his eyes. But Ahmad is no aberration. “This is standard, this is the story that every police torture victim will tell you,” said Rabia Chaudhry, lead researcher at Centre for Public Policy and Governance at Former Christian College, who is researching torture by the police in Pakistan, and was able to deconstruct each decision made by the police in Ahmad’s case. “In this case, since news reports say, the boy’s employer was the one who got the police involved, it will be less about negotiations or police trying to make money from the kidnapping,” explained Chaudhry. And as such no reports of police demanding money from Ahmad or his family have come to light. “If the police are planning on keeping the person for longer than 24 hours, then they will take him off the premises to an outhouse so they can stay away from the eyes of higher officers,” she went on. Ahmad was tortured in a private police torture cell away from the police station.

In addition to regular policing duties, the government has placed the burden on the police to counter threats and violence posed by armed extremist groups and organized crime related to the arms and drug trades and land-grabbing. Institutional constraints that have long hampered the police—such as insufficient human and financial resources, poor infrastructure, problems in the criminal justice system, and interference and influence from internal and external sources—have undergone no serious reforms. All of these issues pose obstacles to the Pakistani police’s ability to enforce law and order in a manner consistent with human rights, and free from corruption and improper influence. Elite elements within Pakistani society—be they politicians, landowners, or members of civil and military bureaucracy—exercise outsized and improper control over law enforcement. Independent analysts and police officials acknowledge that postings to coveted positions, including some station-level appointments, are invariably made on the basis of “political” connections. Pakistan’s Culture of Impunity Pakistan’s police are widely regarded as among the most abusive, corrupt, and unaccountable institutions of the state. Effective systems of accountability and redress for grievances are crucial in order to transform the police from a repressive institution into a service that impartially protects life and property. Police implicated in serious abuses are almost never brought to justice. For example, Syed Alam was killed by the police in 2015 to evade accountability for corruption, according to his father, Umar Daraz. ', 'context_after': '- Discipline or prosecute, as appropriate, superior officers who knew or should have known about acts of torture and killings, and failed to prevent and punish them. - Issue mandatory directives to police that a First Information Report (FIR) should be registered in all cases where a complainant provides information that indicates the occurrence of any criminal offense. - Ensure that the authorized police officer may refuse registration of an FIR only by stating reasons for doing so in writing, signing it, and providing a copy of the same to the complainant. - Explicitly define acceptable interrogation techniques in police rules and manuals, and prohibit police from using illegal detention, torture, or other coercive measures to obtain evidence. - Protect local police departments and their subordinate officials from political and other improper interference and harassment. Methodology This report examines abuses by the police in Pakistan, problems with law enforcement, lack of accountability, and constraints on the police that facilitate such abuses. It also looks at avenues for reforming Pakistan’s police. The report focuses on police operations in three of Pakistan’s four provinces: Balochistan, Sindh, and Punjab. This allows for a comparative analysis drawn from differing legislative and institutional arrangements, and socioeconomic and political contexts. Due to access constraints and security considerations, this report excludes Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, formerly known as the North-West Frontier Province. Human Rights Watch conducted 50 interviews between June 2014 and January 2016 with victims, their family members, and witnesses to police abuses. We conducted more than 30 interviews with police officials at the station, district, provincial, and federal levels. We also interviewed retired police officials, lawyers, human rights advocates, and researchers focusing on police abuse and reform. '}, page_content='Alam was initially arrested at the behest of some people that owed him money and wanted to avoid repayment. Daraz said that the police demanded bribes to release Alam and badly beat him in custody. Although the family borrowed and sold jewelry to pay the police, the police still filed false charges against them. Once Alam was released on bail, the family filed a complaint against the police with the anti-corruption department, after which the officers named in the complaint threatened the family. Daraz told Human Rights Watch: “The police officers started harassing and threatening me, demanding that I take back my complaint, otherwise they would kill me and my son.” Shortly thereafter, Alam disappeared. Four years later, on November 21, 2015, his body was recovered from a garbage dump with clear signs of torture—including bruises, abrasions and cuts—all over his body. In addition to police practices that facilitate impunity and institutional constraints raised by the police, specific provisions of the law, some dating back to colonial British rule, including the Criminal Procedure Code (1898), the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance (1960), and the recently enacted Protection of Pakistan Act (2014), all contribute to a legal framework that protects the police from accountability. The Pakistani government’s tendency to use such legislation has increased as the state has become further embroiled in sectarian violence, militancy, and ethnic conflicts. This report, in highlighting serious police rights violations, constraints on the police in carrying out their duties, and the laws underlying the institutional structure, calls for much-needed police reform to address these issues, most notably in creating mechanisms for grievance redress and accountability for abuses. Key Recommendations - Promptly investigate, and appropriately discipline or prosecute, police officials responsible for human rights violations and delays in recording criminal complaints and initiating investigations for gender-based crimes.

Before purpose-made body bags were available, [cotton](https://alchetron.com/Cotton) [mattress](https://alchetron.com/Mattress) covers were sometimes used, particularly in combat zones during the Second World War. If not available, other materials were used such as bed sheets, blankets, shelter halves, ponchos, sleeping bag covers, tablecloths, curtains, parachute canopies, tarpaulins, or discarded canvas—“sealed in a blanket”—slang. However, the subsequent rubber (and now [plastic](https://alchetron.com/Plastic)) body bag designs are much superior, not least because they prevent leakage of body fluids, which often occurs after someone dies. The dimensions of a body bag are generally around 36 inches by 90 inches (91\\xa0cm by 229\\xa0cm).

This was the subject of [Adrian Mitchell](https://alchetron.com/Adrian-Mitchell)\\'s protest poem \"Fifteen Million Plastic Bags\".\\n\\n![Body bag https4imimgcomdata4RGUQMY1134920deadbo](https://alchetron.com/cdn/body-bag-ce767814-bbde-4add-a1ab-80254dd44b0-resize-750.jpg)\\n\\nBody bags are sometimes portrayed in films and television as being made of a heavy black plastic. Lightweight white body bags have since become popular because it is much easier to spot a piece of evidence that may have been jostled from the body in transit on a white background than on a black background. Even so, black body bags are still in general use. Other typical colors include orange, blue, or gray. Body bags used in the Vietnam War were heavy-duty black rubberized fabric. Regardless of their color, body bags are made of thick plastic and have a full-length [zipper](https://alchetron.com/Zipper) on them. Sometimes the zipper runs straight down the middle. Alternatively, the path of the zipper may be J-shaped or D-shaped. Depending on the design, there are sometimes handles (two on each side) to facilitate lifting. It is possible to write information on the plastic surface of a body bag using a marker pen, and this often happens—either in situ (particularly when a large number of bodies are being collected) or at the mortuary, before being stored in refrigerated cabinets. Alternatively, some designs of body bags have transparent label pockets as an integral part of the design, into which a name-card can be inserted. In any case, a conventional [toe tag](https://alchetron.com/Toe-tag) can easily be tied to one of the lifting handles if required. Body bags are not designed to be washed and re-used, with good reason: aside from the obvious hygiene concerns, re-use of body bags could easily contaminate evidence in the case of a suspicious death. As a result, body bags are routinely discarded and incinerated after one use. In Afghanistan US forces have used body bags to deliver ammunition, medical supplies, and rations to troops in the field. Fifty or so pounds of supplies are packed loose in a body bag and pulled out of the helicopter delivering them to be easily and rapidly dragged to cover by one or two soldiers.\\n\\n![Body bag Body Bag Manufacturers Suppliers amp Wholesalers](https://alchetron.com/cdn/body-bag-2717484f-3906-488b-9c15-22709eeab69-resize-750.jpg)\\n\\nAlthough body bags are most often used for the transport of human remains from their place of discovery to a [funeral home](https://alchetron.com/Funeral-home) or mortuary, they can also be used for temporary burials such as in a combat zone. In such situations, proper funerals are impossible because of imminent enemy attack. This was the situation during the [Falklands War](https://alchetron.com/Falklands-War) of 1982, during which British dead were placed in gray plastic body bags and then laid in mass graves. Some months after the conflict ended, all remains were exhumed from their temporary graves to receive a conventional funeral service with full military honors.\\n\\n![Body bag Skin Body Bag Think Tank Photo](https://alchetron.com/cdn/body-bag-69d773c9-5a55-4dd8-a8ac-8366acc9a97-resize-750.jpeg)\\n\\nThe term \"body bag\" is sometimes used for fashion or other bags worn on the body ( _sling body bag_ or _across body bag_) and this sense has no connection with either of the two above senses.\\n\\n![Body bag Prada Body Bag The Kloons YouTube](https://alchetron.com/cdn/body-bag-3def8a81-3ee6-4717-93a2-94cd2131e37-resize-750.jpeg)\\n\\nWith the addition of provision for breathing, specially ', 'image': '678e463de2f02e5f49857419#CLAIM#0.jpg', 'metadata': {'title': 'Body bag - Alchetron, The Free Social Encyclopedia', 'description': 'A body bag, also known as a cadaver pouch or human remains pouch (HRP), is a nonporous bag designed to contain a human body, used for the storage and transportation of corpses.

Until that is fully established, it makes sense to use this as a potential additional identifier of patients having the virus,\" he said.\\n\\nTo collect more data on these symptoms in Covid-19, the AAO-HNS Infectious Disease and Patient Safety Quality Improvement Committees developed the Covid-19 Anosmia Reporting Tool for Clinicians. Using this tool, healthcare providers of all specialties can confidentially report loss of smell and taste related to Covid-19.\\n\\nAdvt\\n\\nThe tool assesses whether the source of Covid-19 infection is identifiable, risk factors for infections, onset of [anosmia and dysgeusia](https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/anosmia+and+dysgeusia) and what other symptoms started at the same time as anosmia and dysgeusia.\\n\\n\"The value of adding unexplained anosmia as a potential official symptom of Covid-19... would allow earlier detection and isolation of potential carriers and improve safety for healthcare workers,\" Denneny added.\\n\\n\\n- [PTI](https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/agency/87654375/PTI)\\n\\n- Published On Mar 29, 2020 at 11:50 AM IST\\n\\n- - Telegram\\n\\n- Facebook\\n\\n- Copy Link\\n\\n\\n## Comments\\n\\n![comment](https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/et-default-user_1.svg)\\n\\nWhat are your thoughts?\\n\\nComment NowRead Comment (1)\\n\\n## Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals.\\n\\n### Subscribe to Newsletter to get latest insights & analysis in your inbox.\\n\\n## All about ETHealthworld industry right on your smartphone!\\n\\n- [Download the ETHealthworld App](https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.co', 'image': '678e463de2f02e5f49857419#CLAIM#0.jpg', 'metadata': {'title': 'Loss of smell, taste early symptom of Covid-19: Report, ETHealthworld', 'description': 'In light of the reports of these symptoms, AAO-HNS has proposed adding loss of smell and taste — anosmia and dysgeusia — to the list of available screening tools for Covid-19 infection., In light of the reports of these symptoms, AAO-HNS has proposed adding loss of smell and taste — anosmia and dysgeusia — to the list of available screening tools for Covid-19 infection.', 'url': 'https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/diagnostics/loss-of-smell-taste-early-symptom-of-covid-19-report/74871205', 'language': 'en', 'keywords': 'anosmia and dysgeusia, covid-19, American Academy of Otolaryngology, symptoms of coronavirus, common cold', 'robots': 'index, follow, max-image-preview:large', 'og_title': 'Loss of smell, taste early symptom of Covid-19: Report', 'og_description': 'In light of the reports of these symptoms, AAO-HNS has proposed adding loss of smell and taste — anosmia and dysgeusia — to the list of available screening tools for Covid-19 infection.', 'og_url': 'https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/diagnostics/loss-of-smell-taste-early-symptom-of-covid-19-report/74871205', 'og_image': 'https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-74871205,imgsize-49097,width-1200,height=627,overlay-ethealth,resizemode-75/diagnostics/loss-of-smell-taste-early-symptom-of-covid-19-report.jpg', 'og_audio': None, 'og_determiner': None, 'og_locale': None, 'og_locale_alternate': None, 'og_site_name': 'ETHealthworld.com', 'og_video': None, 'favicon': 'https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1686643658-health.ico', 'dc_terms_created': None, 'dc_date_created': None, 'dc_date': None, 'dc_terms_type': None, 'dc_type': None, 'dc_terms_audience': None, 'dc_terms_subject': None, 'dc_subject': None, 'dc_description': None, 'dc_terms_keywords': None, 'modified_time': None, 'published_time': None, 'article_tag': None, 'article_section': None, 'source_url': 'https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/diagnostics/loss-of-smell-taste-early-symptom-of-covid-19-report/74871205', 'status_code': 200, 'scrape_id': '019ada65-f880-709e-a33c-7aa39f9fb2bc', 'num_pages': None, 'content_type': 'text/html;

One of them, though initially difficult for investigators to identify, turned out to be Ukrainian Red Cross volunteer Yevhenii Piskotin.\\n\\n“He was wearing a white shirt, his hands were bound, and he had a beard. He wasn’t from the village; we didn’t know him. Almost three weeks ago, we saw a post on social media that said they were searching for \\\\[missing\\\\] volunteers. From the pictures, we realized it had to be him,” said Andriivka resident Natalia Sidorenko, who worked with her husband to find bodies and bury them.\\n\\nWith the help of a satellite from the American company Planet Labs, journalists were able to determine that the minibus lying next to Piskotin’s body had been in the same spot since March 19. Piskotin had stopped responding to messages two weeks earlier. An employee from the Red Cross’s Poltava regional office said that Piskotin had driven his family to western Ukraine and disappeared on his way back. He was 35 years old. He left behind his mother, his wife, and his two children.\\n\\n### **Oleksiy Cherkovskyi**\\n\\nThe body of 31-year-old Andriivka resident Oleksiy Cherkovskyi was found not far from Piskotin’s body. According to Cherkovskyi neighbors, on the day he died, March 3, he was planning to leave the occupied village along with his family. He went home to get his passport and ran into Russian troops along the way.\\n\\n“The Russians asked him where he was going. He said he was going home. And they took him off somewhere,” said one Andriivka resident, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\\n\\nCherkovskyi was shot in the back.\\n\\n### **Yuriy Kravchenya**\\n\\nAccording to witnesses, Yuriy Kravchenya was shot in the courtyard outside his home in the early days of the occupation. Kravchenya, 46, lived on Andriivka’s main thoroughfare, Melya Street.\\n\\n“They didn't torture him; they just killed him in the courtyard. All we heard was gunfire,” said a village resident named Olga.\\n\\n### **Ihor Yermakov**\\n\\nThe body of 54-year-old Ihor Yermakov was found near an electrical substation. His hands were bound and his body lay face down. According to neighbors, Russian soldiers took Yermakov from his home on March 2.\\n\\n“They told him, ‘Our commander wants to speak with you’,” said Olga, another village resident, on March 2. She saw Yermakov when he was being taken away and again after he was found dead.\\n\\nUkrainian law enforcement officials suspect Russian soldier Daniil Frolkin of killing Yermakov. According to witness statements, Frolkin hit Yermakov multiple times before shooting him in the head.

Body bags can also be used for the storage of corpses within [morgues](https://alchetron.com/Morgue). Before purpose-made body bags were available, [cotton](https://alchetron.com/Cotton) [mattress](https://alchetron.com/Mattress) covers were sometimes used, particularly in combat zones during the Second World War. If not available, other materials were used such as bed sheets, blankets, shelter halves, ponchos, sleeping bag covers, tablecloths, curtains, parachute canopies, tarpaulins, or discarded canvas—“sealed in a blanket”—slang. However, the subsequent rubber (and now [plastic](https://alchetron.com/Plastic)) body bag designs are much superior, not least because they prevent leakage of body fluids, which often occurs after someone dies. The dimensions of a body bag are generally around 36 inches by 90 inches (91\\xa0cm by 229\\xa0cm). Most have some form of carrying handles, usually webbing, at each corner and along the edges.\\n\\n## Contents\\n\\n- [Young m a body bag official video](https://alchetron.com/Body-bag#Young-m-a-body-bag-official-video)\\n- [Llama llama body bags ft cl cliff dir wethepartysean](https://alchetron.com/Body-bag#Llama-llama-body-bags-ft-cl-cliff-dir-wethepartysean)\\n- [References](https://alchetron.com/Body-bag#References)\\n\\n![Body bag Amazoncom Primacare BB3201 Body BagStretcher Combo 90quot Length x](https://alchetron.com/cdn/body-bag-c0fa4c84-588f-429e-a20c-879f8a44f90-resize-750.jpeg)\\n\\nIn modern warfare, body bags have been used to contain the bodies of dead soldiers. Disaster agencies typically have reserves of body bags, both for anticipated wars and natural disasters. During the [Cold War](https://alchetron.com/Cold-War), vast reserves of body bags were built up in anticipation of millions of fatalities from [nuclear war](https://alchetron.com/Nuclear-warfare). This was the subject of [Adrian Mitchell](https://alchetron.com/Adrian-Mitchell)\\'s protest poem \"Fifteen Million Plastic Bags\".\\n\\n![Body bag https4imimgcomdata4RGUQMY1134920deadbo](https://alchetron.com/cdn/body-bag-ce767814-bbde-4add-a1ab-80254dd44b0-resize-750.jpg)\\n\\nBody bags are sometimes portrayed in films and television as being made of a heavy black plastic. Lightweight white body bags have since become popular because it is much easier to spot a piece of evidence that may have been jostled from the body in transit on a white background than on a black background. Even so, black body bags are still in general use. Other typical colors include orange, blue, or gray. Body bags used in the Vietnam War were heavy-duty black rubberized fabric. Regardless of their color, body bags are made of thick plastic and have a full-length [zipper](https://alchetron.com/Zipper) on them. Sometimes the zipper runs straight down the middle. Alternatively, the path of the zipper may be J-shaped or D-shaped. Depending on the design, there are sometimes handles (two on each side) to facilitate lifting. It is possible to write information on the plastic surface of a body bag using a marker pen, and this often happens—either in situ (particularly when a large number of bodies are being collected) or at the mortuary, before being stored in refrigerated cabinets. Alternatively, some designs of body bags have transparent label pockets as an integral part of the design, into which a name-card can be inserted. In any case, a conventional [toe tag](https://alchetron.com/Toe-tag) can easily be tied to one of the lifting handles if required. Body bags are not designed to be washed and re-used, with good reason: aside from the obvious hygiene concerns, re-use of body bags could easily contaminate evidence in the case of a suspicious death. As a result, body bags are routinely discarded and incinerated after one use. In Afghanistan US forces have used body bags to deliver ammunition, medical supplies, and rations to troops in the field. Fifty or so pounds of supplies are packed loose in a body bag and pulled out of the helicopter delivering them to be easily and rapidly dragged to cover by one or two soldiers.\\n\\n![Body bag Body Bag Manufacturers Suppliers amp Wholesalers](https://alchetron.com/cdn/body-bag-2717484f-3906-488b-9c15-22709eeab69-resize-750.jpg)\\n\\nAlthough body bags are most often used for the transport of human remains from their place of discovery to a [funeral home](https://alchetron.com/Funeral-home) or mortuary, they can also be used for temporary burials such as in a combat zone. In such situations, proper funerals are impossible because of imminent enemy attack. This was the situation during the [Falklands War](https://alchetron.com/Falklands-War) of 1982, during which British dead were placed in gray plastic body bags and then laid in mass graves. Some months after the conflict ended, all remains were exhumed from their temporary graves to receive a conventional funeral service with full military honors.\\n\\n![Body bag Skin Body Bag Think Tank Photo](https://alchetron.com/cdn/body-bag-69d773c9-5a55-4dd8-a8ac-8366acc9a97-resize-750.jpeg)\\n\\nThe term \"body bag\" is sometimes used for fashion or other bags worn on the body ( _sling body bag_ or _across body bag_) and this sense has no connection with either of the two above senses.\\n\\n![Body bag Prada Body Bag The Kloons YouTube](https://alchetron.com/cdn/body-bag-3def8a81-3ee6-4717-93a2-94cd2131e37-resize-750.jpeg)\\n\\nWith the addition of provision for breathing, specially ',\n",

Until that is fully established, it makes sense to use this as a potential additional identifier of patients having the virus,\" he said.\\n\\nTo collect more data on these symptoms in Covid-19, the AAO-HNS Infectious Disease and Patient Safety Quality Improvement Committees developed the Covid-19 Anosmia Reporting Tool for Clinicians. Using this tool, healthcare providers of all specialties can confidentially report loss of smell and taste related to Covid-19.\\n\\nAdvt\\n\\nThe tool assesses whether the source of Covid-19 infection is identifiable, risk factors for infections, onset of [anosmia and dysgeusia](https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/anosmia+and+dysgeusia) and what other symptoms started at the same time as anosmia and dysgeusia.\\n\\n\"The value of adding unexplained anosmia as a potential official symptom of Covid-19... would allow earlier detection and isolation of potential carriers and improve safety for healthcare workers,\" Denneny added.\\n\\n\\n- [PTI](https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/agency/87654375/PTI)\\n\\n- Published On Mar 29, 2020 at 11:50 AM IST\\n\\n- - Telegram\\n\\n- Facebook\\n\\n- Copy Link\\n\\n\\n## Comments\\n\\n![comment](https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/et-default-user_1.svg)\\n\\nWhat are your thoughts?\\n\\nComment NowRead Comment (1)\\n\\n## Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals.\\n\\n### Subscribe to Newsletter to get latest insights & analysis in your inbox.\\n\\n## All about ETHealthworld industry right on your smartphone!\\n\\n- [Download the ETHealthworld App](https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.co',\n",

One of them, though initially difficult for investigators to identify, turned out to be Ukrainian Red Cross volunteer Yevhenii Piskotin.\\n\\n“He was wearing a white shirt, his hands were bound, and he had a beard. He wasn’t from the village; we didn’t know him. Almost three weeks ago, we saw a post on social media that said they were searching for \\\\[missing\\\\] volunteers. From the pictures, we realized it had to be him,” said Andriivka resident Natalia Sidorenko, who worked with her husband to find bodies and bury them.\\n\\nWith the help of a satellite from the American company Planet Labs, journalists were able to determine that the minibus lying next to Piskotin’s body had been in the same spot since March 19. Piskotin had stopped responding to messages two weeks earlier. An employee from the Red Cross’s Poltava regional office said that Piskotin had driven his family to western Ukraine and disappeared on his way back. He was 35 years old. He left behind his mother, his wife, and his two children.\\n\\n### **Oleksiy Cherkovskyi**\\n\\nThe body of 31-year-old Andriivka resident Oleksiy Cherkovskyi was found not far from Piskotin’s body. According to Cherkovskyi neighbors, on the day he died, March 3, he was planning to leave the occupied village along with his family. He went home to get his passport and ran into Russian troops along the way.\\n\\n“The Russians asked him where he was going. He said he was going home. And they took him off somewhere,” said one Andriivka resident, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\\n\\nCherkovskyi was shot in the back.\\n\\n### **Yuriy Kravchenya**\\n\\nAccording to witnesses, Yuriy Kravchenya was shot in the courtyard outside his home in the early days of the occupation. Kravchenya, 46, lived on Andriivka’s main thoroughfare, Melya Street.\\n\\n“They didn't torture him; they just killed him in the courtyard. All we heard was gunfire,” said a village resident named Olga.\\n\\n### **Ihor Yermakov**\\n\\nThe body of 54-year-old Ihor Yermakov was found near an electrical substation. His hands were bound and his body lay face down. According to neighbors, Russian soldiers took Yermakov from his home on March 2.\\n\\n“They told him, ‘Our commander wants to speak with you’,” said Olga, another village resident, on March 2. She saw Yermakov when he was being taken away and again after he was found dead.\\n\\nUkrainian law enforcement officials suspect Russian soldier Daniil Frolkin of killing Yermakov. According to witness statements, Frolkin hit Yermakov multiple times before shooting him in the head. When the Russian investiga\",\n",

Body bags can also be used for the storage of corpses within [morgues](https://alchetron.com/Morgue). Before purpose-made body bags were available, [cotton](https://alchetron.com/Cotton) [mattress](https://alchetron.com/Mattress) covers were sometimes used, particularly in combat zones during the Second World War. If not available, other materials were used such as bed sheets, blankets, shelter halves, ponchos, sleeping bag covers, tablecloths, curtains, parachute canopies, tarpaulins, or discarded canvas—“sealed in a blanket”—slang. However, the subsequent rubber (and now [plastic](https://alchetron.com/Plastic)) body bag designs are much superior, not least because they prevent leakage of body fluids, which often occurs after someone dies. The dimensions of a body bag are generally around 36 inches by 90 inches (91\\xa0cm by 229\\xa0cm). Most have some form of carrying handles, usually webbing, at each corner and along the edges.\\n\\n## Contents\\n\\n- [Young m a body bag official video](https://alchetron.com/Body-bag#Young-m-a-body-bag-official-video)\\n- [Llama llama body bags ft cl cliff dir wethepartysean](https://alchetron.com/Body-bag#Llama-llama-body-bags-ft-cl-cliff-dir-wethepartysean)\\n- [References](https://alchetron.com/Body-bag#References)\\n\\n![Body bag Amazoncom Primacare BB3201 Body BagStretcher Combo 90quot Length x](https://alchetron.com/cdn/body-bag-c0fa4c84-588f-429e-a20c-879f8a44f90-resize-750.jpeg)\\n\\nIn modern warfare, body bags have been used to contain the bodies of dead soldiers. Disaster agencies typically have reserves of body bags, both for anticipated wars and natural disasters. During the [Cold War](https://alchetron.com/Cold-War), vast reserves of body bags were built up in anticipation of millions of fatalities from [nuclear war](https://alchetron.com/Nuclear-warfare). This was the subject of [Adrian Mitchell](https://alchetron.com/Adrian-Mitchell)\\'s protest poem \"Fifteen Million Plastic Bags\".\\n\\n![Body bag https4imimgcomdata4RGUQMY1134920deadbo](https://alchetron.com/cdn/body-bag-ce767814-bbde-4add-a1ab-80254dd44b0-resize-750.jpg)\\n\\nBody bags are sometimes portrayed in films and television as being made of a heavy black plastic. Lightweight white body bags have since become popular because it is much easier to spot a piece of evidence that may have been jostled from the body in transit on a white background than on a black background. Even so, black body bags are still in general use. Other typical colors include orange, blue, or gray. Body bags used in the Vietnam War were heavy-duty black rubberized fabric. Regardless of their color, body bags are made of thick plastic and have a full-length [zipper](https://alchetron.com/Zipper) on them. Sometimes the zipper runs straight down the middle. Alternatively, the path of the zipper may be J-shaped or D-shaped. Depending on the design, there are sometimes handles (two on each side) to facilitate lifting. It is possible to write information on the plastic surface of a body bag using a marker pen, and this often happens—either in situ (particularly when a large number of bodies are being collected) or at the mortuary, before being stored in refrigerated cabinets. Alternatively, some designs of body bags have transparent label pockets as an integral part of the design, into which a name-card can be inserted. In any case, a conventional [toe tag](https://alchetron.com/Toe-tag) can easily be tied to one of the lifting handles if required. Body bags are not designed to be washed and re-used, with good reason: aside from the obvious hygiene concerns, re-use of body bags could easily contaminate evidence in the case of a suspicious death. As a result, body bags are routinely discarded and incinerated after one use. In Afghanistan US forces have used body bags to deliver ammunition, medical supplies, and rations to troops in the field. Fifty or so pounds of supplies are packed loose in a body bag and pulled out of the helicopter delivering them to be easily and rapidly dragged to cover by one or two soldiers.\\n\\n![Body bag Body Bag Manufacturers Suppliers amp Wholesalers](https://alchetron.com/cdn/body-bag-2717484f-3906-488b-9c15-22709eeab69-resize-750.jpg)\\n\\nAlthough body bags are most often used for the transport of human remains from their place of discovery to a [funeral home](https://alchetron.com/Funeral-home) or mortuary, they can also be used for temporary burials such as in a combat zone. In such situations, proper funerals are impossible because of imminent enemy attack. This was the situation during the [Falklands War](https://alchetron.com/Falklands-War) of 1982, during which British dead were placed in gray plastic body bags and then laid in mass graves. Some months after the conflict ended, all remains were exhumed from their temporary graves to receive a conventional funeral service with full military honors.\\n\\n![Body bag Skin Body Bag Think Tank Photo](https://alchetron.com/cdn/body-bag-69d773c9-5a55-4dd8-a8ac-8366acc9a97-resize-750.jpeg)\\n\\nThe term \"body bag\" is sometimes used for fashion or other bags worn on the body ( _sling body bag_ or _across body bag_) and this sense has no connection with either of the two above senses.\\n\\n![Body bag Prada Body Bag The Kloons YouTube](https://alchetron.com/cdn/body-bag-3def8a81-3ee6-4717-93a2-94cd2131e37-resize-750.jpeg)\\n\\nWith the addition of provision for breathing, specially ',\n",

Until that is fully established, it makes sense to use this as a potential additional identifier of patients having the virus,\" he said.\\n\\nTo collect more data on these symptoms in Covid-19, the AAO-HNS Infectious Disease and Patient Safety Quality Improvement Committees developed the Covid-19 Anosmia Reporting Tool for Clinicians. Using this tool, healthcare providers of all specialties can confidentially report loss of smell and taste related to Covid-19.\\n\\nAdvt\\n\\nThe tool assesses whether the source of Covid-19 infection is identifiable, risk factors for infections, onset of [anosmia and dysgeusia](https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/anosmia+and+dysgeusia) and what other symptoms started at the same time as anosmia and dysgeusia.\\n\\n\"The value of adding unexplained anosmia as a potential official symptom of Covid-19... would allow earlier detection and isolation of potential carriers and improve safety for healthcare workers,\" Denneny added.\\n\\n\\n- [PTI](https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/agency/87654375/PTI)\\n\\n- Published On Mar 29, 2020 at 11:50 AM IST\\n\\n- - Telegram\\n\\n- Facebook\\n\\n- Copy Link\\n\\n\\n## Comments\\n\\n![comment](https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/et-default-user_1.svg)\\n\\nWhat are your thoughts?\\n\\nComment NowRead Comment (1)\\n\\n## Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals.\\n\\n### Subscribe to Newsletter to get latest insights & analysis in your inbox.\\n\\n## All about ETHealthworld industry right on your smartphone!\\n\\n- [Download the ETHealthworld App](https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.co',\n",

One of them, though initially difficult for investigators to identify, turned out to be Ukrainian Red Cross volunteer Yevhenii Piskotin.\\n\\n“He was wearing a white shirt, his hands were bound, and he had a beard. He wasn’t from the village; we didn’t know him. Almost three weeks ago, we saw a post on social media that said they were searching for \\\\[missing\\\\] volunteers. From the pictures, we realized it had to be him,” said Andriivka resident Natalia Sidorenko, who worked with her husband to find bodies and bury them.\\n\\nWith the help of a satellite from the American company Planet Labs, journalists were able to determine that the minibus lying next to Piskotin’s body had been in the same spot since March 19. Piskotin had stopped responding to messages two weeks earlier. An employee from the Red Cross’s Poltava regional office said that Piskotin had driven his family to western Ukraine and disappeared on his way back. He was 35 years old. He left behind his mother, his wife, and his two children.\\n\\n### **Oleksiy Cherkovskyi**\\n\\nThe body of 31-year-old Andriivka resident Oleksiy Cherkovskyi was found not far from Piskotin’s body. According to Cherkovskyi neighbors, on the day he died, March 3, he was planning to leave the occupied village along with his family. He went home to get his passport and ran into Russian troops along the way.\\n\\n“The Russians asked him where he was going. He said he was going home. And they took him off somewhere,” said one Andriivka resident, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\\n\\nCherkovskyi was shot in the back.\\n\\n### **Yuriy Kravchenya**\\n\\nAccording to witnesses, Yuriy Kravchenya was shot in the courtyard outside his home in the early days of the occupation. Kravchenya, 46, lived on Andriivka’s main thoroughfare, Melya Street.\\n\\n“They didn't torture him; they just killed him in the courtyard. All we heard was gunfire,” said a village resident named Olga.\\n\\n### **Ihor Yermakov**\\n\\nThe body of 54-year-old Ihor Yermakov was found near an electrical substation. His hands were bound and his body lay face down. According to neighbors, Russian soldiers took Yermakov from his home on March 2.\\n\\n“They told him, ‘Our commander wants to speak with you’,” said Olga, another village resident, on March 2. She saw Yermakov when he was being taken away and again after he was found dead.\\n\\nUkrainian law enforcement officials suspect Russian soldier Daniil Frolkin of killing Yermakov. According to witness statements, Frolkin hit Yermakov multiple times before shooting him in the head. When the Russian investiga\",\n",
