That, Murphy said, is to allow schools to be used as polling places. There will be a new online voter registration system. Murphy said it will be up by Sept. 4, “giving new voters an added ability to ensure they get registered.” You can check your registration status on the state’s elections website.

Kristin Corrado, R-Passaic, said it “makes absolutely no sense.” “If New Jersey residents can stand in long lines at Motor Vehicles, we should be able to wait 6 feet apart at the polls in November,” Corrado said. “The reality is most people don’t have to stand around too long waiting to vote. Many are in and out of polling centers in a matter of minutes.” State Sen.

Voter fraud in the U.S. is historically rare, according to multiple studies and statistics. Nearly 1 in 4 voters cast ballots in the 2016 presidential election via mail. Still, New Jersey has had issues with mail-in voting this year. Some voters received the wrong ballots in the mail and some results took weeks to become official. Also, about 1 in 10 people who mailed in ballots in May’s special elections had their votes rejected. And there were allegations of voter fraud in the Paterson City Council race in May. State Attorney General Gurbir Grewal filed voting fraud charges against a city councilman and a councilman-elect. Murphy said Friday that this is actually “positive” because “law enforcement is all over it.\" “If you screw around, you will be caught and be held accountable,” he said. Democratic lawmakers want $3.6 billion in federal funding for mail-in voting and $25 billion to the U.S. Postal Service as part of coronavirus stimulus negotiations. “If they don’t get those two items, that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting because they’re not equipped to have it,” he said Thursday. Meanwhile, Thomas Marshall, the Postal Service’s general counsel and executive vice president, sent New Jersey’s secretary of state a letter July 30 saying that “certain deadlines for requesting and casting mail-in ballots are incongruous with the Postal Service’s delivery standards.” '), Document(metadata={'url': 'https://www.npr.org/2020/07/01/885074932/n-j-election-fraud-case-draws-a-trump-tweet-but-suggests-safeguards-are-working', 'context_before': 'N.J. Election Fraud Case Draws A Trump Tweet But Suggests Safeguards Are Working When President Trump tweeted Sunday night about alleged fraud in a May special election in New Jersey, he tried to wrap it into his ongoing effort to claim voting by mail is less secure than in-person voting. \"Absentee Ballots are fine. A person has to go through a process to get and use them. Mail-In Voting, on the other hand, will lead to the most corrupt Election is USA history. Bad things happen with Mail-Ins,\" he tweeted. \"Just look at Special Election in Patterson, N.J. 19% of Ballots a FRAUD!\" Absentee Ballots are fine. A person has to go through a process to get and use them. Mail-In Voting, on the other hand, will lead to the most corrupt Election is USA history. Bad things happen with Mail-Ins. Just look at Special Election in Patterson, N.J. 19% of Ballots a FRAUD!— But election law experts say that Trump\\'s spotlight on the case also shows both how rare these kinds of cases are and the safeguards in place to protect the integrity of ballots. \"I had been predicting that the Paterson scandal was going to get to the president\\'s attention, because he\\'s been making so many unsupported claims about voter fraud that when there is an actual case involving election crime and absentee ballots, it\\'s not surprising that he\\'s making some hay out of it,\" said Rick Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California Irvine School of Law. Rumors of fraud in Paterson, N.J., had been piling up since the city held a special election for several city council seats on May 12. It was one of several local elections held that day that Gov. Phil Murphy ordered be conducted exclusively by mail-in voting because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Last Thursday, those rumors became criminal allegations. New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal charged Paterson City Councilman Michael Jackson, Councilman-elect Alex Mendez and two other men with voter fraud and other crimes. ', 'context_after': 'When voters cast a ballot in person in New Jersey, they are required to sign a poll book to match their signature to election records. The same is true of mail-in ballots, and election officials check the ballot to make sure the signatures match. During the state\\'s primary on July 7, election officials will notify voters if their ballot was rejected because of a signature mismatch. Burns said it was not only a way for voters to ensure their vote is counted, but it also functions as a warning that another person may have attempted to vote fraudulently in their name. UC Irvine\\'s Hasen said the security measures used in New Jersey were likely enough to raise the suspicion of authorities. \"Even on this small scale, what you see is that having a conspiracy like this to try to affect the outcome of an election is very difficult to do without detection.\" Burns suggested the rare instances of election fraud are not typically committed by individual voters themselves but rather organized groups. \"This is not a voter fraud issue,\" she said. \"It\\'s crimes being committed against voters.\" Hasen emphasized that the Paterson case shows how difficult carrying out the kind of widespread fraud Trump insists is possible. '}, page_content='The investigation started after the U.S. Postal Inspection Service tipped off state law enforcement officials to hundreds of mail-in ballots stuffed in a Paterson mailbox. Other bundled ballots were discovered in another nearby city. In New Jersey, voters are expected to mail or submit their mail-in ballots themselves unless they certify a \"bearer\" to do it on their behalf. A bearer can collect and deliver ballots for no more than three voters in an election, and a candidate in the election cannot serve as a bearer. Jackson, the councilman, had more than three mail-in ballots that were not his and that did not identify him as the bearer, authorities said. Mendez allegedly delivered mail-in ballots that were not his even though he was a candidate and is accused of submitting voter registration applications for people who were not eligible to vote in that election. \"We will not allow a small number of criminals to undermine the public\\'s confidence in our democratic process,\" said Attorney General Grewal. The Passaic County Board of Elections rejected 3,190 ballots, about 19% of the mail-in ballots submitted, for the May 12 election in Paterson, but it is unclear how many were connected to the fraud allegations. In fact, there are many more common reasons for a ballot to be thrown out, such as a signature that doesn\\'t match election records or if the ballot was received after the deadline. It was also the first election in New Jersey conducted entirely vote-by-mail, and officials have warned of hiccups in matching signatures, processing paper ballots and receiving the mail on time. Although critics including Trump have claimed that a surge in mail-in voting will leave the election system prone to fraud, voting rights advocates in New Jersey say some of the same security features that exist for in-person voting also feature in vote-by-mail. \"There is a huge myth about voter fraud in this country,\" said Jesse Burns, executive director of the League of Women Voters of New Jersey. '), Document(metadata={'url': 'https://newjerseyglobe.com/campaigns/reports-of-vbm/', 'context_before': '“After proper distribution of the mailings to every resident, the unaddressed extra pieces of these standard ‘Local Postal Customer’ mailings were left outside the mailboxes for community center pickups. As a follow-up, the extra pieces were redelivered with residents receiving multiple pieces of the same mailings,” said George B. Flood, a spokesperson for the U.S. Post Service. “No official ballots or personal, First Class Mail items were included.” Later in the day, the postal service appeared to back off their claim. “We received an additional photo of reportedly undelivered mail from another address in Belleville and are looking into the matter further,” Flood said in an email to the Globe. “We will share the results of that administrative review as soon as the information becomes available.” The statement followed a complaint lodged by Rep. Albio Sires (D-West New York), who represents Belleville in Congress. “I spoke to Mayor Melham earlier today regarding the delivery of absentee ballots. I placed a call to the Regional Director to express my concerns regarding this very serious matter in Belleville” Sires told the Globe. “He informed me that a comprehensive administrative review has been initiated. I will monitor this situation and hope for a timely review of this matter.” According to the 2010 U.S. Census data, 49% of Belleville residents live in rental housing, although not all of them are in apartment buildings. That raises a question: are ballots for tenants being treated differently than people living in single family homes? “They have to figure that out,” said Phyllis Salowe-Kaye, the executive director of New Jersey Citizen Action and one of the state’s leading advocates of tenants rights. “Tenants, small business owners and low-income residents are the people who are getting screwed. You can’t take away their right to vote. Salowe-Kaye, who supports vote-by-mail elections, said that ballots can’t be put in a pile “like a Bed Bath & Beyond circular.” ', 'context_after': ''}, page_content='She said that problems with the delivery of ballots could call the credibility of the election into question.” In an all-VBM election, the process for replacing ballots is complicated. Since there are no polling locations, provisional ballots will not exist. With a little more than two weeks to go before Election Day, it would be up to individual voters to proactively contact a county clerk to request a replacement ballot. The onus would be on the voter to download the correct form and sent it to the clerk’s office in time to receive a new ballot and mail it before 8 PM on May 12. In the 2019 Linden school board race, a candidate who lost by just 243 votes filed a complaint alleging that about 570 of her direct mail pieces were returned to her doorstep three weeks later. Earlier this year, the U.S. Postal Service said it would not guarantee the delivery of political mailings unless they are dropped at the post office at least seven to ten days before Election Day. Opponents of all-VBM elections – something Murphy says remains on the table for the July 7 primary election – say that opportunities for voter fraud could accompany elections that increase the use of mail-in ballots. “I think that mail-in voting is a terrible thing,” said President Donald Trump during a coronavirus briefing earlier this month. The New Jersey legislature has not yet acted on a proposal by State Sen. Samuel Thompson (R-Old Bridge) to increase penalties for voter fraud. “To all the naysayers who continue to claim that voter fraud isn’t happening in New Jersey, I implore you: open your eyes,” Thompson said in 2018. “I hate to say I told you so, but clearly, the current penalties are not strong enough to stop slimy political operatives from stealing votes.

Fact check: True A tweet on June 28 by President Trump cited voter fraud in a New Jersey election in order to bolster his argument against mail-in voting. Trump claimed that nearly 20 percent of ballots in a special election for city council representatives were fraudulent. The municipal election was held in May in Paterson, N.J., for several city council seats. It was among a handful of elections that Gov. Phil Murphy ordered be completed exclusively by mail-in voting due to the coronavirus pandemic. To make the process easier, Murphy signed an executive order in March for ballots to be sent to all registered voters without the need for an application. But claims of fraud began appearing in local media as early as election day. According to a report by NPR, the fraud investigation began after the U.S. Postal Inspection Service informed local law enforcement that hundreds of mail-in ballots were stuffed inside a Paterson mailbox. More than 1,200 ballets were initially tossed due to issues with voter signatures and another 1,000 were dumped because the person who dropped off the ballots did not correctly fill out the envelope to indicate they were the \"bearer\" of the ballots. New Jersey law allows a \"bearer\" to collect and deliver up to three ballots per election; however, this right does not extend to candidates. Three months after the election, four men were charged by state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal with illegally collecting or possessing ballots, including two winning city council candidates. The nonprofit Paterson Press found that votes had been cast in the names of three deceased individuals. And another resident listed as having voted said she did not receive a vote-by-mail ballot, according to NBC New York. In total, election officials admitted that more than 3,000 mail-in ballots, about 19 percent of those submitted, were disqualified. - Bill to stop \\'prison gerrymandering\\' advances in New Jersey - The ... › ')], metadata=None)"

Rumors of fraud in Paterson, N.J., had been piling up since the city held a special election for several city council seats on May 12. It was one of several local elections held that day that Gov. Phil Murphy ordered be conducted exclusively by mail-in voting because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Last Thursday, those rumors became criminal allegations. New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal charged Paterson City Councilman Michael Jackson, Councilman-elect Alex Mendez and two other men with voter fraud and other crimes. \\nThe investigation started after the U.S. Postal Inspection Service tipped off state law enforcement officials to hundreds of mail-in ballots stuffed in a Paterson mailbox. Other bundled ballots were discovered in another nearby city. In New Jersey, voters are expected to mail or submit their mail-in ballots themselves unless they certify a \"bearer\" to do it on their behalf. A bearer can collect and deliver ballots for no more than three voters in an election, and a candidate in the election cannot serve as a bearer. Jackson, the councilman, had more than three mail-in ballots that were not his and that did not identify him as the bearer, authorities said. Mendez allegedly delivered mail-in ballots that were not his even though he was a candidate and is accused of submitting voter registration applications for people who were not eligible to vote in that election. \"We will not allow a small number of criminals to undermine the public\\'s confidence in our democratic process,\" said Attorney General Grewal. The Passaic County Board of Elections rejected 3,190 ballots, about 19% of the mail-in ballots submitted, for the May 12 election in Paterson, but it is unclear how many were connected to the fraud allegations. In fact, there are many more common reasons for a ballot to be thrown out, such as a signature that doesn\\'t match election records or if the ballot was received after the deadline. It was also the first election in New Jersey conducted entirely vote-by-mail, and officials have warned of hiccups in matching signatures, processing paper ballots and receiving the mail on time. Although critics including Trump have claimed that a surge in mail-in voting will leave the election system prone to fraud, voting rights advocates in New Jersey say some of the same security features that exist for in-person voting also feature in vote-by-mail. \"There is a huge myth about voter fraud in this country,\" said Jesse Burns, executive director of the League of Women Voters of New Jersey. \\nWhen voters cast a ballot in person in New Jersey, they are required to sign a poll book to match their signature to election records. The same is true of mail-in ballots, and election officials check the ballot to make sure the signatures match. During the state\\'s primary on July 7, election officials will notify voters if their ballot was rejected because of a signature mismatch. Burns said it was not only a way for voters to ensure their vote is counted, but it also functions as a warning that another person may have attempted to vote fraudulently in their name. UC Irvine\\'s Hasen said the security measures used in New Jersey were likely enough to raise the suspicion of authorities. \"Even on this small scale, what you see is that having a conspiracy like this to try to affect the outcome of an election is very difficult to do without detection.\" Burns suggested the rare instances of election fraud are not typically committed by individual voters themselves but rather organized groups. \"This is not a voter fraud issue,\" she said. \"It\\'s crimes being committed against voters.\" Hasen emphasized that the Paterson case shows how difficult carrying out the kind of widespread fraud Trump insists is possible.

There will be at least 10 in each county, officials said. That’s at least twice the 105 used during the July primary. “Ensuring not only that everyone gets a ballot, but that they have secure ways of returning that ballot, are central to our belief that our democracy stronger when everyone has the opportunity participate in it,” Murphys aid. “This mattered before the pandemic and has even greater urgency now.” All public schools in New Jersey will be closed to in-person instruction on Election Day. That, Murphy said, is to allow schools to be used as polling places. There will be a new online voter registration system. Murphy said it will be up by Sept. 4, “giving new voters an added ability to ensure they get registered.” You can check your registration status on the state’s elections website. You have until Oct. 13 to register. If you have problems, you ca visit the state’s elections website, call the state’s Voter Protection hotline at 1-877-NJVOTER, or reach out to your local officials. You can also track your ballot on the state’s elections website. That will show if it gets back to your county’s board of elections, New Jersey Secretary of State Tahesha Way said. “Now expect everything to take time, but stay on top of where your ballot is,” Way said. New Jersey had a similar setup in the July primaries. Voting was mostly mail-in, with some in-person voting across the state. The state also delayed a number of local elections earlier in the year and made those races vote-by-mail only. Murphy said the primary gave the state “the opportunity to see what worked and where we could make improvements to this kind of election.” But November will be larger scale — and higher stakes. Of course, there’s the big presidential race pitting Trump, a Republican, against former Vice President Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger. \\nPlus, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., is running for re-election against Republican Rik Mehta. And all 12 of New Jersey’s U.S. House seats are on the ballot. Turnout is expected to be much higher than the primary. He and other Republicans have spoken out against it repeatedly in recent weeks, warning it could lead to fraud and delayed results. Trump has argued without evidence that the 2020 election could lead to “the greatest fraud in history.” This could set up a collision course between Trump and Murphy after months of playing nice with each other during the pandemic. Voter fraud in the U.S. is historically rare, according to multiple studies and statistics. Nearly 1 in 4 voters cast ballots in the 2016 presidential election via mail. Still, New Jersey has had issues with mail-in voting this year. Some voters received the wrong ballots in the mail and some results took weeks to become official. Also, about 1 in 10 people who mailed in ballots in May’s special elections had their votes rejected. And there were allegations of voter fraud in the Paterson City Council race in May. State Attorney General Gurbir Grewal filed voting fraud charges against a city councilman and a councilman-elect. Murphy said Friday that this is actually “positive” because “law enforcement is all over it.\" “If you screw around, you will be caught and be held accountable,” he said. Democratic lawmakers want $3.6 billion in federal funding for mail-in voting and $25 billion to the U.S. Postal Service as part of coronavirus stimulus negotiations. “If they don’t get those two items, that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting because they’re not equipped to have it,” he said Thursday. Meanwhile, Thomas Marshall, the Postal Service’s general counsel and executive vice president, sent New Jersey’s secretary of state a letter July 30 saying that “certain deadlines for requesting and casting mail-in ballots are incongruous with the Postal Service’s delivery standards.” \\nThat creates a “significant risk” a ballot could be requested and returned too late to be counted, Marshall said. Still, some of his concerns involved residents requesting to vote absentee, which won’t be necessary because everyone will automatically be sent a ballot. Plus, the state is giving a week for clerks to receive ballots after Election Day. CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES: Live map tracker | Newsletter | Homepage Murphy said Friday “it’s ridiculous the post office is being politicized.\" But, he said, “I believe with all my heart it will be funded and cooler heads will prepare.” U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-9th Dist., has asked New Jeesey’s state attorney general to investigate whether Trump and U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy are trying to subvert the general election by slowing down delivery and refusing to adequately fund the Postal Service. State Sen. Kristin Corrado, R-Passaic, said it “makes absolutely no sense.” “If New Jersey residents can stand in long lines at Motor Vehicles, we should be able to wait 6 feet apart at the polls in November,” Corrado said. “The reality is most people don’t have to stand around too long waiting to vote. Many are in and out of polling centers in a matter of minutes.” State Sen. Michael Testa, R-Cumberland, said the plan will “create unnecessary confusion.” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House’s leading infectious disease expert, said recently: “If you go and wear a mask, if you observe the physical distancing, and don’t have a crowded situation, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t be able” to vote in-person. “I mean, obviously if you’re a person who is compromised physically or otherwise, you don’t want to take the chance,” he added. New Jersey is one of four states, plus Washington, D.C., to announce they will proactively mail ballots to voters before the election this year. Five states already have mostly mail-in elections: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, and Washingon. Our journalism needs your support. Please subscribe today to NJ.com.

Fact check: True A tweet on June 28 by President Trump cited voter fraud in a New Jersey election in order to bolster his argument against mail-in voting. Trump claimed that nearly 20 percent of ballots in a special election for city council representatives were fraudulent. The municipal election was held in May in Paterson, N.J., for several city council seats. It was among a handful of elections that Gov. Phil Murphy ordered be completed exclusively by mail-in voting due to the coronavirus pandemic. To make the process easier, Murphy signed an executive order in March for ballots to be sent to all registered voters without the need for an application. But claims of fraud began appearing in local media as early as election day. According to a report by NPR, the fraud investigation began after the U.S. Postal Inspection Service informed local law enforcement that hundreds of mail-in ballots were stuffed inside a Paterson mailbox. More than 1,200 ballets were initially tossed due to issues with voter signatures and another 1,000 were dumped because the person who dropped off the ballots did not correctly fill out the envelope to indicate they were the \"bearer\" of the ballots. New Jersey law allows a \"bearer\" to collect and deliver up to three ballots per election; however, this right does not extend to candidates. Three months after the election, four men were charged by state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal with illegally collecting or possessing ballots, including two winning city council candidates. The nonprofit Paterson Press found that votes had been cast in the names of three deceased individuals. And another resident listed as having voted said she did not receive a vote-by-mail ballot, according to NBC New York. In total, election officials admitted that more than 3,000 mail-in ballots, about 19 percent of those submitted, were disqualified. - Bill to stop \\'prison gerrymandering\\' advances in New Jersey - The ... › \\n- Upstate NY election resolved with discovery of lost ballots - The Fulcrum › - Republican Rep.

The number of states mailing ballots to all registered voters has also doubled, going from five in 2016 to 10 this year. The New York Times has reported that ballot request data indicates that more Democrats than Republicans are likely to vote by mail in 2020. “It would be very difficult to orchestrate some kind of national election fraud”To understand whether mistaken mail-in ballots could lead to significant election fraud, the FRANCE 24 Observers team spoke to professors Lonna Atkeson of the University of New Mexico and Trey Hood of the University of Georgia, both specialists in election administration. Dr. Hood said that erroneously sent ballots are only a threat if someone tries to use them to vote: \\n“These administrative mistakes occur. If you’re a state that’s suddenly ramping up your mail-in balloting because of the coronavirus, there’s likely to be more mistakes made. But unless someone takes the ballot of a deceased person and votes on their behalf, it’s not fraud. Voter fraud from what we can tell is fairly rare and episodic.” A comprehensive review by the Brennan Center of Justice found that voter fraud in the United States is rare and does not approach rates that would be required to “rig” an election. An in-depth 2014 study published by the Washington Post found 31 credible instances of voter impersonation fraud from 2000 to 2014, out of a total of one billion ballots cast. There has been at least one instance of targeted mail-in ballot fraud this year, Dr. Atkeson said: “Mail-in voting is not filled with fraud, but the fraud that we find is targeted in places where election results are going to be close. An example of this is a municipal election earlier this year in Paterson, New Jersey that was overturned after charges of mail-in voter fraud caused nearly 20 percent of the ballots to be rejected. It would be very difficult to orchestrate some kind of national election fraud. But the fear in universal mail-in voting is that you’re creating more opportunity for mischief and losing chain of custody for ballots.” “Security checks should prevent the most egregious acts of fraud”More than half of states check the signatures on incoming mail-in ballots against signatures they have on file for registered voters, but Dr. Atkeson says that the rigour of these checks varies. “Every state has their own more or less stringent process for qualifying ballots. In states with universal vote-by-mail like Colorado and Utah, we certainly see instances where submitted ballots are signed by someone other than the voter and those are caught. \")], metadata={'suggested_label': array([0.45764028, 0.06193488, 0.45764028, 0.02278457]), 'llm_type': 'gpt-4o', 'llm_output': {'questions': [{'question': 'Were mail-in ballots sent to deceased individuals in New Jersey during the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election?', 'answer': 'Yes, there were reports of mail-in ballots being sent to deceased individuals in New Jersey.', 'source': '1'}, {'question': 'Did Carolyn Quinn report receiving mail-in ballots for her deceased parents in New Jersey?', 'answer': 'Yes, Carolyn Quinn reported receiving mail-in ballots for her deceased parents in Union County, New Jersey.', 'source': '1'}, {'question': 'Is there any mention of mail-in ballots being sent to deceased individuals in Mercer County, New Jersey?', 'answer': 'No, there is no specific mention of mail-in ballots being sent to deceased individuals in Mercer County, New Jersey.', 'source': '1'}, {'question': 'What county did Carolyn Quinn report receiving mail-in ballots for her deceased parents?', 'answer': 'Union County, New Jersey.', 'source': '1'}, {'question': 'Is there evidence of widespread voter fraud due to mail-in ballots in New Jersey?', 'answer': 'No, voter fraud is considered rare and episodic, and there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud due to mail-in ballots.', 'source': '1'}, {'question': \"Were there any instances of voter fraud in New Jersey's 2020 elections?\", 'answer': 'Yes, there were instances of voter fraud in the Paterson City Council election, but not specifically related to the Presidential Election.', 'source': '3'}, {'question': 'What measures are in place to prevent mail-in ballot fraud in New Jersey?', 'answer': 'New Jersey has security measures such as signature matching to prevent mail-in ballot fraud.', 'source': '3'}, {'question': 'Did New Jersey have issues with mail-in voting in 2020?', 'answer': 'Yes, New Jersey had issues such as voters receiving wrong ballots and delays in results.', 'source': '2'}, {'question': 'What percentage of mail-in ballots were rejected in the Paterson City Council election?', 'answer': 'About 19% of mail-in ballots were rejected in the Paterson City Council election.', 'source': '5'}, {'question': 'Is there any evidence that mail-in ballots sent to deceased individuals led to voter fraud in the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election?', 'answer': 'No, there is no evidence that mail-in ballots sent to deceased individuals led to voter fraud in the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election.', 'source': '1'}], 'claim_veracity': {'Supported': '2', 'Refuted': '4', 'Not Enough Evidence': '4', 'Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking': '1'}}})"

A total of 24 states now allow mail-in voting for any reason including fear of the coronavirus, compared with 16 in 2016. The number of states mailing ballots to all registered voters has also doubled, going from five in 2016 to 10 this year. The New York Times has reported that ballot request data indicates that more Democrats than Republicans are likely to vote by mail in 2020. “It would be very difficult to orchestrate some kind of national election fraud”To understand whether mistaken mail-in ballots could lead to significant election fraud, the FRANCE 24 Observers team spoke to professors Lonna Atkeson of the University of New Mexico and Trey Hood of the University of Georgia, both specialists in election administration. Dr. Hood said that erroneously sent ballots are only a threat if someone tries to use them to vote: \\n“These administrative mistakes occur. If you’re a state that’s suddenly ramping up your mail-in balloting because of the coronavirus, there’s likely to be more mistakes made. But unless someone takes the ballot of a deceased person and votes on their behalf, it’s not fraud. Voter fraud from what we can tell is fairly rare and episodic.” A comprehensive review by the Brennan Center of Justice found that voter fraud in the United States is rare and does not approach rates that would be required to “rig” an election. An in-depth 2014 study published by the Washington Post found 31 credible instances of voter impersonation fraud from 2000 to 2014, out of a total of one billion ballots cast. There has been at least one instance of targeted mail-in ballot fraud this year, Dr. Atkeson said: “Mail-in voting is not filled with fraud, but the fraud that we find is targeted in places where election results are going to be close. An example of this is a municipal election earlier this year in Paterson, New Jersey that was overturned after charges of mail-in voter fraud caused nearly 20 percent of the ballots to be rejected. It would be very difficult to orchestrate some kind of national election fraud. But the fear in universal mail-in voting is that you’re creating more opportunity for mischief and losing chain of custody for ballots.” “Security checks should prevent the most egregious acts of fraud”More than half of states check the signatures on incoming mail-in ballots against signatures they have on file for registered voters, but Dr. Atkeson says that the rigour of these checks varies. “Every state has their own more or less stringent process for qualifying ballots. In states with universal vote-by-mail like Colorado and Utah, we certainly see instances where submitted ballots are signed by someone other than the voter and those are caught. \")\n",

Rumors of fraud in Paterson, N.J., had been piling up since the city held a special election for several city council seats on May 12. It was one of several local elections held that day that Gov. Phil Murphy ordered be conducted exclusively by mail-in voting because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Last Thursday, those rumors became criminal allegations. New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal charged Paterson City Councilman Michael Jackson, Councilman-elect Alex Mendez and two other men with voter fraud and other crimes. \\nThe investigation started after the U.S. Postal Inspection Service tipped off state law enforcement officials to hundreds of mail-in ballots stuffed in a Paterson mailbox. Other bundled ballots were discovered in another nearby city. In New Jersey, voters are expected to mail or submit their mail-in ballots themselves unless they certify a \"bearer\" to do it on their behalf. A bearer can collect and deliver ballots for no more than three voters in an election, and a candidate in the election cannot serve as a bearer. Jackson, the councilman, had more than three mail-in ballots that were not his and that did not identify him as the bearer, authorities said. Mendez allegedly delivered mail-in ballots that were not his even though he was a candidate and is accused of submitting voter registration applications for people who were not eligible to vote in that election. \"We will not allow a small number of criminals to undermine the public\\'s confidence in our democratic process,\" said Attorney General Grewal. The Passaic County Board of Elections rejected 3,190 ballots, about 19% of the mail-in ballots submitted, for the May 12 election in Paterson, but it is unclear how many were connected to the fraud allegations. In fact, there are many more common reasons for a ballot to be thrown out, such as a signature that doesn\\'t match election records or if the ballot was received after the deadline. It was also the first election in New Jersey conducted entirely vote-by-mail, and officials have warned of hiccups in matching signatures, processing paper ballots and receiving the mail on time. Although critics including Trump have claimed that a surge in mail-in voting will leave the election system prone to fraud, voting rights advocates in New Jersey say some of the same security features that exist for in-person voting also feature in vote-by-mail. \"There is a huge myth about voter fraud in this country,\" said Jesse Burns, executive director of the League of Women Voters of New Jersey. \\nWhen voters cast a ballot in person in New Jersey, they are required to sign a poll book to match their signature to election records. The same is true of mail-in ballots, and election officials check the ballot to make sure the signatures match. During the state\\'s primary on July 7, election officials will notify voters if their ballot was rejected because of a signature mismatch. Burns said it was not only a way for voters to ensure their vote is counted, but it also functions as a warning that another person may have attempted to vote fraudulently in their name. UC Irvine\\'s Hasen said the security measures used in New Jersey were likely enough to raise the suspicion of authorities. \"Even on this small scale, what you see is that having a conspiracy like this to try to affect the outcome of an election is very difficult to do without detection.\" Burns suggested the rare instances of election fraud are not typically committed by individual voters themselves but rather organized groups. \"This is not a voter fraud issue,\" she said. \"It\\'s crimes being committed against voters.\" Hasen emphasized that the Paterson case shows how difficult carrying out the kind of widespread fraud Trump insists is possible.

There will be at least 10 in each county, officials said. That’s at least twice the 105 used during the July primary. “Ensuring not only that everyone gets a ballot, but that they have secure ways of returning that ballot, are central to our belief that our democracy stronger when everyone has the opportunity participate in it,” Murphys aid. “This mattered before the pandemic and has even greater urgency now.” All public schools in New Jersey will be closed to in-person instruction on Election Day. That, Murphy said, is to allow schools to be used as polling places. There will be a new online voter registration system. Murphy said it will be up by Sept. 4, “giving new voters an added ability to ensure they get registered.” You can check your registration status on the state’s elections website. You have until Oct. 13 to register. If you have problems, you ca visit the state’s elections website, call the state’s Voter Protection hotline at 1-877-NJVOTER, or reach out to your local officials. You can also track your ballot on the state’s elections website. That will show if it gets back to your county’s board of elections, New Jersey Secretary of State Tahesha Way said. “Now expect everything to take time, but stay on top of where your ballot is,” Way said. New Jersey had a similar setup in the July primaries. Voting was mostly mail-in, with some in-person voting across the state. The state also delayed a number of local elections earlier in the year and made those races vote-by-mail only. Murphy said the primary gave the state “the opportunity to see what worked and where we could make improvements to this kind of election.” But November will be larger scale — and higher stakes. Of course, there’s the big presidential race pitting Trump, a Republican, against former Vice President Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger. \\nPlus, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., is running for re-election against Republican Rik Mehta. And all 12 of New Jersey’s U.S. House seats are on the ballot. Turnout is expected to be much higher than the primary. He and other Republicans have spoken out against it repeatedly in recent weeks, warning it could lead to fraud and delayed results. Trump has argued without evidence that the 2020 election could lead to “the greatest fraud in history.” This could set up a collision course between Trump and Murphy after months of playing nice with each other during the pandemic. Voter fraud in the U.S. is historically rare, according to multiple studies and statistics. Nearly 1 in 4 voters cast ballots in the 2016 presidential election via mail. Still, New Jersey has had issues with mail-in voting this year. Some voters received the wrong ballots in the mail and some results took weeks to become official. Also, about 1 in 10 people who mailed in ballots in May’s special elections had their votes rejected. And there were allegations of voter fraud in the Paterson City Council race in May. State Attorney General Gurbir Grewal filed voting fraud charges against a city councilman and a councilman-elect. Murphy said Friday that this is actually “positive” because “law enforcement is all over it.\" “If you screw around, you will be caught and be held accountable,” he said. Democratic lawmakers want $3.6 billion in federal funding for mail-in voting and $25 billion to the U.S. Postal Service as part of coronavirus stimulus negotiations. “If they don’t get those two items, that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting because they’re not equipped to have it,” he said Thursday. Meanwhile, Thomas Marshall, the Postal Service’s general counsel and executive vice president, sent New Jersey’s secretary of state a letter July 30 saying that “certain deadlines for requesting and casting mail-in ballots are incongruous with the Postal Service’s delivery standards.” \\nThat creates a “significant risk” a ballot could be requested and returned too late to be counted, Marshall said. Still, some of his concerns involved residents requesting to vote absentee, which won’t be necessary because everyone will automatically be sent a ballot. Plus, the state is giving a week for clerks to receive ballots after Election Day. CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES: Live map tracker | Newsletter | Homepage Murphy said Friday “it’s ridiculous the post office is being politicized.\" But, he said, “I believe with all my heart it will be funded and cooler heads will prepare.” U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-9th Dist., has asked New Jeesey’s state attorney general to investigate whether Trump and U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy are trying to subvert the general election by slowing down delivery and refusing to adequately fund the Postal Service. State Sen. Kristin Corrado, R-Passaic, said it “makes absolutely no sense.” “If New Jersey residents can stand in long lines at Motor Vehicles, we should be able to wait 6 feet apart at the polls in November,” Corrado said. “The reality is most people don’t have to stand around too long waiting to vote. Many are in and out of polling centers in a matter of minutes.” State Sen. Michael Testa, R-Cumberland, said the plan will “create unnecessary confusion.” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House’s leading infectious disease expert, said recently: “If you go and wear a mask, if you observe the physical distancing, and don’t have a crowded situation, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t be able” to vote in-person. “I mean, obviously if you’re a person who is compromised physically or otherwise, you don’t want to take the chance,” he added. New Jersey is one of four states, plus Washington, D.C., to announce they will proactively mail ballots to voters before the election this year. Five states already have mostly mail-in elections: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, and Washingon. Our journalism needs your support. Please subscribe today to NJ.com. ')\n",
      "Evidence(question='What percentage of mail-in ballots were rejected in the Paterson City Council election?', answer='About 19% of mail-in ballots were rejected in the Paterson City Council election.', url='https://thefulcrum.us/fact-check/paterson-election-fraud', scraped_text='\\nClaim: New Jersey election officials threw out nearly 20 percent of mail-in ballots. Fact check: True A tweet on June 28 by President Trump cited voter fraud in a New Jersey election in order to bolster his argument against mail-in voting. Trump claimed that nearly 20 percent of ballots in a special election for city council representatives were fraudulent. The municipal election was held in May in Paterson, N.J., for several city council seats. It was among a handful of elections that Gov. Phil Murphy ordered be completed exclusively by mail-in voting due to the coronavirus pandemic. To make the process easier, Murphy signed an executive order in March for ballots to be sent to all registered voters without the need for an application. But claims of fraud began appearing in local media as early as election day. According to a report by NPR, the fraud investigation began after the U.S. Postal Inspection Service informed local law enforcement that hundreds of mail-in ballots were stuffed inside a Paterson mailbox. More than 1,200 ballets were initially tossed due to issues with voter signatures and another 1,000 were dumped because the person who dropped off the ballots did not correctly fill out the envelope to indicate they were the \"bearer\" of the ballots. New Jersey law allows a \"bearer\" to collect and deliver up to three ballots per election; however, this right does not extend to candidates. Three months after the election, four men were charged by state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal with illegally collecting or possessing ballots, including two winning city council candidates. The nonprofit Paterson Press found that votes had been cast in the names of three deceased individuals. And another resident listed as having voted said she did not receive a vote-by-mail ballot, according to NBC New York. In total, election officials admitted that more than 3,000 mail-in ballots, about 19 percent of those submitted, were disqualified. - Bill to stop \\'prison gerrymandering\\' advances in New Jersey - The ... › \\n- Upstate NY election resolved with discovery of lost ballots - The Fulcrum › - Republican Rep.

Rumors of fraud in Paterson, N.J., had been piling up since the city held a special election for several city council seats on May 12. It was one of several local elections held that day that Gov. Phil Murphy ordered be conducted exclusively by mail-in voting because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Last Thursday, those rumors became criminal allegations. New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal charged Paterson City Councilman Michael Jackson, Councilman-elect Alex Mendez and two other men with voter fraud and other crimes. \\nThe investigation started after the U.S. Postal Inspection Service tipped off state law enforcement officials to hundreds of mail-in ballots stuffed in a Paterson mailbox. Other bundled ballots were discovered in another nearby city. In New Jersey, voters are expected to mail or submit their mail-in ballots themselves unless they certify a \"bearer\" to do it on their behalf. A bearer can collect and deliver ballots for no more than three voters in an election, and a candidate in the election cannot serve as a bearer. Jackson, the councilman, had more than three mail-in ballots that were not his and that did not identify him as the bearer, authorities said. Mendez allegedly delivered mail-in ballots that were not his even though he was a candidate and is accused of submitting voter registration applications for people who were not eligible to vote in that election. \"We will not allow a small number of criminals to undermine the public\\'s confidence in our democratic process,\" said Attorney General Grewal. The Passaic County Board of Elections rejected 3,190 ballots, about 19% of the mail-in ballots submitted, for the May 12 election in Paterson, but it is unclear how many were connected to the fraud allegations. In fact, there are many more common reasons for a ballot to be thrown out, such as a signature that doesn\\'t match election records or if the ballot was received after the deadline. It was also the first election in New Jersey conducted entirely vote-by-mail, and officials have warned of hiccups in matching signatures, processing paper ballots and receiving the mail on time. Although critics including Trump have claimed that a surge in mail-in voting will leave the election system prone to fraud, voting rights advocates in New Jersey say some of the same security features that exist for in-person voting also feature in vote-by-mail. \"There is a huge myth about voter fraud in this country,\" said Jesse Burns, executive director of the League of Women Voters of New Jersey. \\nWhen voters cast a ballot in person in New Jersey, they are required to sign a poll book to match their signature to election records. The same is true of mail-in ballots, and election officials check the ballot to make sure the signatures match.

Burns said it was not only a way for voters to ensure their vote is counted, but it also functions as a warning that another person may have attempted to vote fraudulently in their name. UC Irvine\\'s Hasen said the security measures used in New Jersey were likely enough to raise the suspicion of authorities. \"Even on this small scale, what you see is that having a conspiracy like this to try to affect the outcome of an election is very difficult to do without detection.\" Burns suggested the rare instances of election fraud are not typically committed by individual voters themselves but rather organized groups. \"This is not a voter fraud issue,\" she said. \"It\\'s crimes being committed against voters.\" Hasen emphasized that the Paterson case shows how difficult carrying out the kind of widespread fraud Trump insists is possible.

Fact check: True A tweet on June 28 by President Trump cited voter fraud in a New Jersey election in order to bolster his argument against mail-in voting. Trump claimed that nearly 20 percent of ballots in a special election for city council representatives were fraudulent. The municipal election was held in May in Paterson, N.J., for several city council seats. It was among a handful of elections that Gov. Phil Murphy ordered be completed exclusively by mail-in voting due to the coronavirus pandemic. To make the process easier, Murphy signed an executive order in March for ballots to be sent to all registered voters without the need for an application. But claims of fraud began appearing in local media as early as election day. According to a report by NPR, the fraud investigation began after the U.S. Postal Inspection Service informed local law enforcement that hundreds of mail-in ballots were stuffed inside a Paterson mailbox. More than 1,200 ballets were initially tossed due to issues with voter signatures and another 1,000 were dumped because the person who dropped off the ballots did not correctly fill out the envelope to indicate they were the \"bearer\" of the ballots. New Jersey law allows a \"bearer\" to collect and deliver up to three ballots per election; however, this right does not extend to candidates. Three months after the election, four men were charged by state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal with illegally collecting or possessing ballots, including two winning city council candidates. The nonprofit Paterson Press found that votes had been cast in the names of three deceased individuals. And another resident listed as having voted said she did not receive a vote-by-mail ballot, according to NBC New York. In total, election officials admitted that more than 3,000 mail-in ballots, about 19 percent of those submitted, were disqualified. - Bill to stop \\'prison gerrymandering\\' advances in New Jersey - The ... › \\n- Upstate NY election resolved with discovery of lost ballots - The Fulcrum › - Republican Rep.

Election Fraud Case Draws A Trump Tweet But Suggests Safeguards Are Working When President Trump tweeted Sunday night about alleged fraud in a May special election in New Jersey, he tried to wrap it into his ongoing effort to claim voting by mail is less secure than in-person voting. \"Absentee Ballots are fine. A person has to go through a process to get and use them. Mail-In Voting, on the other hand, will lead to the most corrupt Election is USA history. Bad things happen with Mail-Ins,\" he tweeted. \"Just look at Special Election in Patterson, N.J. 19% of Ballots a FRAUD!\" Absentee Ballots are fine. A person has to go through a process to get and use them. Mail-In Voting, on the other hand, will lead to the most corrupt Election is USA history. Bad things happen with Mail-Ins. Just look at Special Election in Patterson, N.J. 19% of Ballots a FRAUD!— But election law experts say that Trump\\'s spotlight on the case also shows both how rare these kinds of cases are and the safeguards in place to protect the integrity of ballots. \"I had been predicting that the Paterson scandal was going to get to the president\\'s attention, because he\\'s been making so many unsupported claims about voter fraud that when there is an actual case involving election crime and absentee ballots, it\\'s not surprising that he\\'s making some hay out of it,\" said Rick Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California Irvine School of Law. Rumors of fraud in Paterson, N.J., had been piling up since the city held a special election for several city council seats on May 12. It was one of several local elections held that day that Gov. Phil Murphy ordered be conducted exclusively by mail-in voting because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Last Thursday, those rumors became criminal allegations. New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal charged Paterson City Councilman Michael Jackson, Councilman-elect Alex Mendez and two other men with voter fraud and other crimes. \\nThe investigation started after the U.S. Postal Inspection Service tipped off state law enforcement officials to hundreds of mail-in ballots stuffed in a Paterson mailbox. Other bundled ballots were discovered in another nearby city. In New Jersey, voters are expected to mail or submit their mail-in ballots themselves unless they certify a \"bearer\" to do it on their behalf. A bearer can collect and deliver ballots for no more than three voters in an election, and a candidate in the election cannot serve as a bearer. Jackson, the councilman, had more than three mail-in ballots that were not his and that did not identify him as the bearer, authorities said. Mendez allegedly delivered mail-in ballots that were not his even though he was a candidate and is accused of submitting voter registration applications for people who were not eligible to vote in that election. \"We will not allow a small number of criminals to undermine the public\\'s confidence in our democratic process,\" said Attorney General Grewal. The Passaic County Board of Elections rejected 3,190 ballots, about 19% of the mail-in ballots submitted, for the May 12 election in Paterson, but it is unclear how many were connected to the fraud allegations. In fact, there are many more common reasons for a ballot to be thrown out, such as a signature that doesn\\'t match election records or if the ballot was received after the deadline. It was also the first election in New Jersey conducted entirely vote-by-mail, and officials have warned of hiccups in matching signatures, processing paper ballots and receiving the mail on time. Although critics including Trump have claimed that a surge in mail-in voting will leave the election system prone to fraud, voting rights advocates in New Jersey say some of the same security features that exist for in-person voting also feature in vote-by-mail. \"There is a huge myth about voter fraud in this country,\" said Jesse Burns, executive director of the League of Women Voters of New Jersey. \\nWhen voters cast a ballot in person in New Jersey, they are required to sign a poll book to match their signature to election records. The same is true of mail-in ballots, and election officials check the ballot to make sure the signatures match. During the state\\'s primary on July 7, election officials will notify voters if their ballot was rejected because of a signature mismatch. Burns said it was not only a way for voters to ensure their vote is counted, but it also functions as a warning that another person may have attempted to vote fraudulently in their name. UC Irvine\\'s Hasen said the security measures used in New Jersey were likely enough to raise the suspicion of authorities. \"Even on this small scale, what you see is that having a conspiracy like this to try to affect the outcome of an election is very difficult to do without detection.\" Burns suggested the rare instances of election fraud are not typically committed by individual voters themselves but rather organized groups. \"This is not a voter fraud issue,\" she said. \"It\\'s crimes being committed against voters.\" Hasen emphasized that the Paterson case shows how difficult carrying out the kind of widespread fraud Trump insists is possible.

       " Evidence(question='What is the general consensus on the prevalence of voter fraud in mail-in voting?', answer='The general consensus is that voter fraud in mail-in voting is rare and episodic.', url='https://observers.france24.com/en/20201014-voter-fraud-us-voters-post-photos-mail-inl-ballots-trump', scraped_text=\"'Voter Fraud Alert!' - US voters post photos of their unsolicited mail-in ballots online This year’s US presidential election will see unprecedented numbers of Americans sending in their ballots by mail due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, as states moved to expand voting by mail, President Trump and his supporters have cast doubt on the integrity of mail-in ballots, particularly “universal mail-in voting” where states automatically send ballots to all registered and active voters. In recent weeks, voters have been expressing concern on social media after receiving mail-in ballots for people who have moved or passed away. On September 30, Twitter user Richie McGinniss posted a picture of what he said were four ballots from Washington D.C. for people who no longer lived in his home. His post provoked a flurry of worried responses and was retweeted by White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who called it an example of a system “prone to fraud”. The Fake News media tells us mail-in voting is an air tight system with no potential for fraud. Kayleigh McEnany (@kayleighmcenany) September 30, 2020 And yet, here’s another example of just how prone to fraud the system is... https://t.co/woqWWCoajp On September 27, Facebook user Tom Daniel posted a picture of an automatically mailed ballot from New Jersey that he claimed was sent to him mistakenly. In a message with the hashtag #TRUMP2020, he said he had lived and voted in Florida since 2016, and called on other users to “expose the fraud coming out of states who automatically send out mail-in ballots”, adding: “we know which side is pushing for this”. Both New Jersey and Washington D.C. are mailing ballots to all active and registered voters due to the coronavirus. I just received my automatically distributed mail-in ballot in MIDDLESEX COUNTY, NJ, after having never participated in...Posted by Tom Daniel on Sunday, September 27, 2020 \\nPresident Trump has sent at least eight tweets since September about what he calls “unsolicited ballots”, warning that states are sending “80 million unsolicited ballots to voters” and that “the Unsolicited Mail In Ballot Scam is a major threat to our Democracy, & the Democrats know it.” Others report receiving ballots for dead relatives, like Twitter user Carolyn Quinn, who posted a picture on October 6 of mail-in ballots from New Jersey that were meant for her deceased parents with the caption: “VOTER FRAUD ALERT!”. Quinn told the FRANCE 24 Observers that her parents both passed away around one year ago, and provided court documents attesting to the fact. VOTER FRAUD ALERT! Write-in ballots for my late parents from Union County, NJ were just forwarded to me in another state. If these hadn't arrived I wouldn't believe it could happen. Beware of what's going on in Union County! #realdonaldtrump #JoeBiden #Election2020 pic.twitter.com/qDI3MrY2cHCarolyn Quinn (@sequinrosette) October 5, 2020 Twitter user Carolyn Quinn sent documents to the France 24 Observers showing that her parents are deceased. In 2020, the coronavirus has spurred 23 states and Washington D.C. to expand voting by mail. A total of 24 states now allow mail-in voting for any reason including fear of the coronavirus, compared with 16 in 2016. The number of states mailing ballots to all registered voters has also doubled, going from five in 2016 to 10 this year. The New York Times has reported that ballot request data indicates that more Democrats than Republicans are likely to vote by mail in 2020. “It would be very difficult to orchestrate some kind of national election fraud”To understand whether mistaken mail-in ballots could lead to significant election fraud, the FRANCE 24 Observers team spoke to professors Lonna Atkeson of the University of New Mexico and Trey Hood of the University of Georgia, both specialists in election administration. Dr. Hood said that erroneously sent ballots are only a threat if someone tries to use them to vote: \\n“These administrative mistakes occur. If you’re a state that’s suddenly ramping up your mail-in balloting because of the coronavirus, there’s likely to be more mistakes made. But unless someone takes the ballot of a deceased person and votes on their behalf, it’s not fraud. Voter fraud from what we can tell is fairly rare and episodic.” A comprehensive review by the Brennan Center of Justice found that voter fraud in the United States is rare and does not approach rates that would be required to “rig” an election. An in-depth 2014 study published by the Washington Post found 31 credible instances of voter impersonation fraud from 2000 to 2014, out of a total of one billion ballots cast. There has been at least one instance of targeted mail-in ballot fraud this year, Dr. Atkeson said: “Mail-in voting is not filled with fraud, but the fraud that we find is targeted in places where election results are going to be close. An example of this is a municipal election earlier this year in Paterson, New Jersey that was overturned after charges of mail-in voter fraud caused nearly 20 percent of the ballots to be rejected. It would be very difficult to orchestrate some kind of national election fraud. But the fear in universal mail-in voting is that you’re creating more opportunity for mischief and losing chain of custody for ballots.” “Security checks should prevent the most egregious acts of fraud”More than half of states check the signatures on incoming mail-in ballots against signatures they have on file for registered voters, but Dr. Atkeson says that the rigour of these checks varies. “Every state has their own more or less stringent process for qualifying ballots. In states with universal vote-by-mail like Colorado and Utah, we certainly see instances where submitted ballots are signed by someone other than the voter and those are caught. \"),\n",
       " Evidence(question='Did New Jersey implement any new measures for the 2020 election to ensure the integrity of mail-in voting?', answer='Yes, New Jersey implemented measures such as secure drop boxes and an online voter registration system to ensure the integrity of mail-in voting.', url='https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/08/what-you-need-to-know-about-njs-mostly-mail-in-ballot-elections-with-all-the-controversy.html', scraped_text='The state will also set up secure boxes where you can drop your ballot. There will be at least 10 in each county, officials said. That’s at least twice the 105 used during the July primary. “Ensuring not only that everyone gets a ballot, but that they have secure ways of returning that ballot, are central to our belief that our democracy stronger when everyone has the opportunity participate in it,” Murphys aid. “This mattered before the pandemic and has even greater urgency now.” All public schools in New Jersey will be closed to in-person instruction on Election Day. That, Murphy said, is to allow schools to be used as polling places. There will be a new online voter registration system. Murphy said it will be up by Sept. 4, “giving new voters an added ability to ensure they get registered.” You can check your registration status on the state’s elections website. You have until Oct. 13 to register. If you have problems, you ca visit the state’s elections website, call the state’s Voter Protection hotline at 1-877-NJVOTER, or reach out to your local officials. You can also track your ballot on the state’s elections website. That will show if it gets back to your county’s board of elections, New Jersey Secretary of State Tahesha Way said. “Now expect everything to take time, but stay on top of where your ballot is,” Way said. New Jersey had a similar setup in the July primaries. Voting was mostly mail-in, with some in-person voting across the state. The state also delayed a number of local elections earlier in the year and made those races vote-by-mail only. Murphy said the primary gave the state “the opportunity to see what worked and where we could make improvements to this kind of election.” But November will be larger scale — and higher stakes. Of course, there’s the big presidential race pitting Trump, a Republican, against former Vice President Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger. \\nPlus, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., is running for re-election against Republican Rik Mehta. And all 12 of New Jersey’s U.S. House seats are on the ballot. Turnout is expected to be much higher than the primary. He and other Republicans have spoken out against it repeatedly in recent weeks, warning it could lead to fraud and delayed results. Trump has argued without evidence that the 2020 election could lead to “the greatest fraud in history.” This could set up a collision course between Trump and Murphy after months of playing nice with each other during the pandemic. Voter fraud in the U.S. is historically rare, according to multiple studies and statistics. Nearly 1 in 4 voters cast ballots in the 2016 presidential election via mail. Still, New Jersey has had issues with mail-in voting this year. Some voters received the wrong ballots in the mail and some results took weeks to become official. Also, about 1 in 10 people who mailed in ballots in May’s special elections had their votes rejected. And there were allegations of voter fraud in the Paterson City Council race in May. State Attorney General Gurbir Grewal filed voting fraud charges against a city councilman and a councilman-elect. Murphy said Friday that this is actually “positive” because “law enforcement is all over it.\" “If you screw around, you will be caught and be held accountable,” he said. Democratic lawmakers want $3.6 billion in federal funding for mail-in voting and $25 billion to the U.S. Postal Service as part of coronavirus stimulus negotiations. “If they don’t get those two items, that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting because they’re not equipped to have it,” he said Thursday. Meanwhile, Thomas Marshall, the Postal Service’s general counsel and executive vice president, sent New Jersey’s secretary of state a letter July 30 saying that “certain deadlines for requesting and casting mail-in ballots are incongruous with the Postal Service’s delivery standards.” \\nThat creates a “significant risk” a ballot could be requested and returned too late to be counted, Marshall said. Still, some of his concerns involved residents requesting to vote absentee, which won’t be necessary because everyone will automatically be sent a ballot. Plus, the state is giving a week for clerks to receive ballots after Election Day. CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES: Live map tracker | Newsletter | Homepage Murphy said Friday “it’s ridiculous the post office is being politicized.\" But, he said, “I believe with all my heart it will be funded and cooler heads will prepare.” U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-9th Dist., has asked New Jeesey’s state attorney general to investigate whether Trump and U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy are trying to subvert the general election by slowing down delivery and refusing to adequately fund the Postal Service. State Sen. Kristin Corrado, R-Passaic, said it “makes absolutely no sense.” “If New Jersey residents can stand in long lines at Motor Vehicles, we should be able to wait 6 feet apart at the polls in November,” Corrado said. “The reality is most people don’t have to stand around too long waiting to vote. Many are in and out of polling centers in a matter of minutes.” State Sen. Michael Testa, R-Cumberland, said the plan will “create unnecessary confusion.” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House’s leading infectious disease expert, said recently: “If you go and wear a mask, if you observe the physical distancing, and don’t have a crowded situation, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t be able” to vote in-person. “I mean, obviously if you’re a person who is compromised physically or otherwise, you don’t want to take the chance,” he added. New Jersey is one of four states, plus Washington, D.C., to announce they will proactively mail ballots to voters before the election this year. Five states already have mostly mail-in elections: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, and Washingon. Our journalism needs your support. Please subscribe today to NJ.com. ')]"

Kamala Harris of California. On Tuesday, during the first (and hopefully last) 2020 presidential debate, Biden stated outright that he does not support the Green New Deal, a preposterous multitrillion-dollar plan to make the economy more environmentally friendly. “The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward,” Biden alleged. “We’re not going to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants.” Moderator Chris Wallace interjected for clarity, “But do you support the Green New Deal?” “No,” Biden answered definitively. “I don’t support the Green New Deal. I support the Biden plan that I put forward. … The Biden plan, which is different than what [President Trump] calls the radical Green New Deal.” Well, this is awkward, and for a couple of reasons. First, it seems strange to disavow the Green New Deal after alleging specifically that it will “pay for itself as we move forward.” Second, the 2020 Biden campaign website still includes a line that reads, “Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face. It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2) our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected.” Lastly, there is the fact that Biden’s own running mate is an early supporter of the Green New Deal. In February 2019, two Green New Deal resolutions were introduced in Congress. Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York introduced a resolution in the House. Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts introduced a resolution in the Senate. The Green New Deal, as introduced, is a mishmash of platitudes, wishful thinking, and totally unworkable policy proposals. \\nFor example, it calls for the upgrading or replacing of every building in the U.S. over a 10-year period to achieve compliance with environmental standards as outlined by the initiative. The Green New Deal should “be accomplished through a 10-year national mobilization that will require,” among other things, “upgrading all existing buildings in the United States and building new buildings to achieve maximal energy efficiency, water efficiency, safety, affordability, comfort, and durability, including through electrification,” states the Senate’s nonbinding resolution. Not even Ocasio-Cortez’s aggressive 70% marginal tax rate on the wealthy could generate the sort of cash that would be needed to see every single building in the U.S. either replaced or upgraded to meet the bill’s requirements. Oh, by the way, the Green New Deal would cost anywhere between $6.6 trillion and $94.4 trillion, depending on whose estimate you trust. These obvious drawbacks did not deter Markey from introducing his resolution in the U.S. Senate. The nonstarters did not deter 14 of his Democratic colleagues from throwing their support behind the resolution. The bill’s cosponsors include independent Sen.

      "Evidence(question='What is the relationship between the Biden Plan and the Green New Deal according to Joe Biden?', answer='Joe Biden stated that the Biden Plan is different from the Green New Deal, although it shares some elements.', url='https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/does-biden-support-green-new-deal/', scraped_text='Biden said during the first 2020 presidential debate that he does not support the Green New Deal, a congressional resolution that lays out a set of proposals for tackling climate change. Instead, he said he supports the \"Biden Plan,\" which itself refers to the Green New Deal as a “crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges.\" Despite sharing certain elements in common with the Green New Deal, the Biden Plan also differs from it in significant ways, so it would be inaccurate to claim Biden supports the Green New Deal in its entirety. During the first 2020 U.S. presidential debate held in Cleveland on Sept. 29, Democratic nominee Joe Biden said he does not support the Green New Deal, a resolution introduced in Congress by members of his own party proposing strategies for dealing with climate change, but instead backs the “Biden Plan” for doing so, which is laid out on his campaign website. Biden\\'s disavowal came on the heels of an attempt by his opponent, U.S. President Donald Trump, to tie him to the Green New Deal, claiming it would cost $100 trillion if implemented. Biden\\'s responses (which begin one hour and 20 minutes into the below video clip) were as follows: “That is not my plan. The Green New Deal is not my plan.” “The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. We’re not going to build plants that in fact are great polluting plants.” “No, I don’t support the Green New Deal. I support the Biden Plan that I put forward. The Biden Plan, which is different than what [Trump] calls the ‘radical Green New Deal.’” https://www.c-span.org/video/?475793-1/trump-biden-debate These statements sparked criticism from Republicans like Omar Navarro, who ran three unsuccessful bids for California’s 43d Congressional District in 2016, 2018, and again in 2020. On Sept. 30, Navarro shared a screenshot from Biden’s website that described the Green New Deal as a “crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges…” \\nThe language in the tweeted screenshot above was indeed found on Biden’s website as of Sept. 30, but was taken out of context and doesn\\'t reflect the differences between the Biden Plan and the Green New Deal, which we will discuss below. The Green New Deal resolution was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on Feb. 7, 2019, in response to Trump’s 2017 announcement that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change. The 14-page proposal sets forth a number of policies aimed at lowering greenhouse gas emissions produced by American companies, creating high-wage jobs for Americans, and to set an overall framework for environmental justice and resiliency against climate change-related disasters. It is important to note that the Green New Deal is nonbinding, and if it were to pass, nothing outlined within its pages would become law. Biden made climate change a cornerstone of his 2020 bid for the presidency, in turn criticizing Trump\\'s handling of environmental affairs. It is true that the Biden Plan (archived here for reference) includes elements of the Green New Deal and is similar to it in that both plans agree that the U.S. needs to act urgently and epically to meet the scope of the climate change challenge, and that the environment and the economy are “completely and totally connected.” The Biden Plan addresses many of the issues outlined in the Green New Deal, with the addition of specific actions that a Biden administration would take should he be elected in November 2020. We dug through both proposals to understand the nuances between the two, where they differ, and where they are the same. Generally speaking, both policies establish a similar framework but differ in the specifics of how policymakers should go about enforcing and reaching defined goals. \\nFor example, both plans highlight the importance of clean, safe drinking water and community-driven projects that promote social and environmental justice in areas disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change. The greatest difference between the Biden Plan and the Green New Deal lies in their stances on the Paris Agreement, an international agreement established in 2015 with the central aim of coordinating and strengthening the global response to climate change and keeping the global temperature rise in this century below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Whereas the Biden Plan promises a recommitment to the Paris Agreement, the Green New Deal does not mention it at all. When it comes to clean energy, the Green New Deal and the Biden Plan are similar in that they aim to achieve 100% clean energy and net-zero emissions, but the former sets forth a 10-year mobilization deadline, whereas the Biden Plan sets a goal of no later than 2050. Both plans establish priorities for investment in clean energy innovation and research; however, the Biden Plan is far vaguer. The Green New Deal goes into greater detail, specifying that those investments should include infrastructure and industry, sustainable farming and land-use practices, zero-emission vehicle infrastructure, manufacturing public transit, removing greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and industry, and the research and development of new clean and renewable energy technologies. Other key areas of overlap between the two plans include creating resiliency across the nation and committing to international policy and trade that employ strong labor and environmental protections. According to his website, the Biden plan will be paid for by rolling back Trump tax incentives and will require a federal investment of $1.7 trillion over the next decade, leveraging the additional private sector and state and local investments to total more than $5 trillion.

      "Evidence(question='What are some key differences between the Biden Plan and the Green New Deal?', answer='The Biden Plan sets a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 and does not include broader economic reforms like universal healthcare, unlike the Green New Deal.', url='https://dailyutahchronicle.com/2020/10/14/kincart-vote-biden-to-combat-climate-change/', scraped_text='\\nAt the first presidential debate, Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president, Joe Biden, made it clear that he did not support the Green New Deal. He said, “I don’t support the Green New Deal. I support the Biden plan I put forward.” Contrarily, at the vice presidential debate, Mike Pence attempted to argue that a Biden-Harris administration would “impose the Green New Deal.” So which answer is correct? Well the truth is, Biden does not support the Green New Deal and a claim as bold as his at the debate has the potential to alienate more progressive voters. His climate policy also leaves room to hurt his standing with younger voters, for whom climate justice is their top issue. But this election season, we must acknowledge that although Joe Biden does not support the Green New Deal, voting for him is crucial to combating climate change and supporting the environmental justice movement. Despite the fact that Joe Biden doesn’t support the Green New Deal, Biden’s climate plan recognizes that the Green New Deal provides a “crucial framework” for the climate issues we are facing. He plans for the US to accomplish net-zero emission and an entirely clean energy economy by 2050 through investing in clean energy and economic incentives. Biden’s plan also accounts for better infrastructure, global action, the disproportionate harms on communities of color and low-income communities, as well as worker and community contributions. His proposals are similar to the Green New Deal because it focuses on standards, investments and justice. But the Biden plan is much more narrow than the Green New Deal, neglecting broader economic reforms like universal healthcare, as addressed in the Green New Deal. His plan also fails to ban fracking which is “a key step to protect against the economic losses from climate disruption” according to Kassie Siegel, director of the Climate Law Institute at the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity. So in actuality, Biden’s climate plan really isn’t really that radical. \\nAdditionally, Joe Biden actually has a decent record when it comes to climate change. He introduced the first climate change legislation into the Senate during the Reagan administration. His record is applauded by the League of Conservation Voters (LVC) who decided to endorse the candidate on April 20. The endorsement of a climate group like the LVC is not without meaning. This endorsement symbolizes that there is a candidate ready to take action on one of the most pressing issues facing Americans today. Similarly, the Washington Post Editorial Board describes Joe Biden’s climate plan as “pretty good.” They argue that his climate policies compared to Trump’s earn Biden an “A-plus” because “Biden gets many things right.” Even though Biden’s climate plan isn’t the Green New Deal, it’s better than nothing. His plan enacts “mainstream and obvious” policies for a more environmentally conscious planet. When your choices are a candidate with an OK climate plan and one who has consistently rolled back environmental regulations that would help the US fight climate change, voting for the former makes more sense. However, let’s still acknowledge that though Senator Harris enthusiastically reminded the public that she will not ban fracking, “fracking is bad, actually” according to congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez. His plan is not the best, but since climate change is the most pressing threat to our existence, a candidate willing to acknowledge its severity is our best option. It boils down to the fact that any policy is better than no policy. Action must be taken now — we can’t wait around for the perfect climate candidate. Consequentially, voting for Joe Biden paves the way for the climate justice movement to progress and is crucial for the Green New Deal to succeed in the future. Senator Ed Markey, a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, recognizes this truth. ')\n",

Kamala Harris of California. On Tuesday, during the first (and hopefully last) 2020 presidential debate, Biden stated outright that he does not support the Green New Deal, a preposterous multitrillion-dollar plan to make the economy more environmentally friendly. “The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward,” Biden alleged. “We’re not going to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants.” Moderator Chris Wallace interjected for clarity, “But do you support the Green New Deal?” “No,” Biden answered definitively. “I don’t support the Green New Deal. I support the Biden plan that I put forward. … The Biden plan, which is different than what [President Trump] calls the radical Green New Deal.” Well, this is awkward, and for a couple of reasons. First, it seems strange to disavow the Green New Deal after alleging specifically that it will “pay for itself as we move forward.” Second, the 2020 Biden campaign website still includes a line that reads, “Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face. It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2) our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected.” Lastly, there is the fact that Biden’s own running mate is an early supporter of the Green New Deal. In February 2019, two Green New Deal resolutions were introduced in Congress. Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York introduced a resolution in the House. Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts introduced a resolution in the Senate. The Green New Deal, as introduced, is a mishmash of platitudes, wishful thinking, and totally unworkable policy proposals. \\nFor example, it calls for the upgrading or replacing of every building in the U.S. over a 10-year period to achieve compliance with environmental standards as outlined by the initiative. The Green New Deal should “be accomplished through a 10-year national mobilization that will require,” among other things, “upgrading all existing buildings in the United States and building new buildings to achieve maximal energy efficiency, water efficiency, safety, affordability, comfort, and durability, including through electrification,” states the Senate’s nonbinding resolution. Not even Ocasio-Cortez’s aggressive 70% marginal tax rate on the wealthy could generate the sort of cash that would be needed to see every single building in the U.S. either replaced or upgraded to meet the bill’s requirements. Oh, by the way, the Green New Deal would cost anywhere between $6.6 trillion and $94.4 trillion, depending on whose estimate you trust. These obvious drawbacks did not deter Markey from introducing his resolution in the U.S. Senate. The nonstarters did not deter 14 of his Democratic colleagues from throwing their support behind the resolution. The bill’s cosponsors include independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Democratic Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Cory Booker of New Jersey. ')\n"

Dr. Hood said that erroneously sent ballots are only a threat if someone tries to use them to vote: \\n“These administrative mistakes occur. If you’re a state that’s suddenly ramping up your mail-in balloting because of the coronavirus, there’s likely to be more mistakes made. But unless someone takes the ballot of a deceased person and votes on their behalf, it’s not fraud. Voter fraud from what we can tell is fairly rare and episodic.” A comprehensive review by the Brennan Center of Justice found that voter fraud in the United States is rare and does not approach rates that would be required to “rig” an election. An in-depth 2014 study published by the Washington Post found 31 credible instances of voter impersonation fraud from 2000 to 2014, out of a total of one billion ballots cast. There has been at least one instance of targeted mail-in ballot fraud this year, Dr. Atkeson said: “Mail-in voting is not filled with fraud, but the fraud that we find is targeted in places where election results are going to be close. An example of this is a municipal election earlier this year in Paterson, New Jersey that was overturned after charges of mail-in voter fraud caused nearly 20 percent of the ballots to be rejected. It would be very difficult to orchestrate some kind of national election fraud. But the fear in universal mail-in voting is that you’re creating more opportunity for mischief and losing chain of custody for ballots.” “Security checks should prevent the most egregious acts of fraud”More than half of states check the signatures on incoming mail-in ballots against signatures they have on file for registered voters, but Dr. Atkeson says that the rigour of these checks varies. “Every state has their own more or less stringent process for qualifying ballots. In states with universal vote-by-mail like Colorado and Utah, we certainly see instances where submitted ballots are signed by someone other than the voter and those are caught. \"), Evidence(question=\"Were the deceased individuals' ballots sent to Mercer County?\", answer='No, the reported case of mail-in ballots being sent to deceased individuals was in Union County, not Mercer County.', url='https://observers.france24.com/en/20201014-voter-fraud-us-voters-post-photos-mail-inl-ballots-trump', scraped_text=\"'Voter Fraud Alert!' - US voters post photos of their unsolicited mail-in ballots online This year’s US presidential election will see unprecedented numbers of Americans sending in their ballots by mail due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Election Fraud Case Draws A Trump Tweet But Suggests Safeguards Are Working When President Trump tweeted Sunday night about alleged fraud in a May special election in New Jersey, he tried to wrap it into his ongoing effort to claim voting by mail is less secure than in-person voting. \"Absentee Ballots are fine. A person has to go through a process to get and use them. Mail-In Voting, on the other hand, will lead to the most corrupt Election is USA history. Bad things happen with Mail-Ins,\" he tweeted. \"Just look at Special Election in Patterson, N.J. 19% of Ballots a FRAUD!\" Absentee Ballots are fine. A person has to go through a process to get and use them. Mail-In Voting, on the other hand, will lead to the most corrupt Election is USA history. Bad things happen with Mail-Ins. Just look at Special Election in Patterson, N.J. 19% of Ballots a FRAUD!— But election law experts say that Trump\\'s spotlight on the case also shows both how rare these kinds of cases are and the safeguards in place to protect the integrity of ballots. \"I had been predicting that the Paterson scandal was going to get to the president\\'s attention, because he\\'s been making so many unsupported claims about voter fraud that when there is an actual case involving election crime and absentee ballots, it\\'s not surprising that he\\'s making some hay out of it,\" said Rick Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California Irvine School of Law. Rumors of fraud in Paterson, N.J., had been piling up since the city held a special election for several city council seats on May 12. It was one of several local elections held that day that Gov. Phil Murphy ordered be conducted exclusively by mail-in voting because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Last Thursday, those rumors became criminal allegations. New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal charged Paterson City Councilman Michael Jackson, Councilman-elect Alex Mendez and two other men with voter fraud and other crimes. \\nThe investigation started after the U.S. Postal Inspection Service tipped off state law enforcement officials to hundreds of mail-in ballots stuffed in a Paterson mailbox. Other bundled ballots were discovered in another nearby city. In New Jersey, voters are expected to mail or submit their mail-in ballots themselves unless they certify a \"bearer\" to do it on their behalf. A bearer can collect and deliver ballots for no more than three voters in an election, and a candidate in the election cannot serve as a bearer. Jackson, the councilman, had more than three mail-in ballots that were not his and that did not identify him as the bearer, authorities said. Mendez allegedly delivered mail-in ballots that were not his even though he was a candidate and is accused of submitting voter registration applications for people who were not eligible to vote in that election. \"We will not allow a small number of criminals to undermine the public\\'s confidence in our democratic process,\" said Attorney General Grewal. The Passaic County Board of Elections rejected 3,190 ballots, about 19% of the mail-in ballots submitted, for the May 12 election in Paterson, but it is unclear how many were connected to the fraud allegations. In fact, there are many more common reasons for a ballot to be thrown out, such as a signature that doesn\\'t match election records or if the ballot was received after the deadline. It was also the first election in New Jersey conducted entirely vote-by-mail, and officials have warned of hiccups in matching signatures, processing paper ballots and receiving the mail on time. Although critics including Trump have claimed that a surge in mail-in voting will leave the election system prone to fraud, voting rights advocates in New Jersey say some of the same security features that exist for in-person voting also feature in vote-by-mail. \"There is a huge myth about voter fraud in this country,\" said Jesse Burns, executive director of the League of Women Voters of New Jersey. \\nWhen voters cast a ballot in person in New Jersey, they are required to sign a poll book to match their signature to election records. The same is true of mail-in ballots, and election officials check the ballot to make sure the signatures match. During the state\\'s primary on July 7, election officials will notify voters if their ballot was rejected because of a signature mismatch. Burns said it was not only a way for voters to ensure their vote is counted, but it also functions as a warning that another person may have attempted to vote fraudulently in their name. UC Irvine\\'s Hasen said the security measures used in New Jersey were likely enough to raise the suspicion of authorities. \"Even on this small scale, what you see is that having a conspiracy like this to try to affect the outcome of an election is very difficult to do without detection.\" Burns suggested the rare instances of election fraud are not typically committed by individual voters themselves but rather organized groups. \"This is not a voter fraud issue,\" she said. \"It\\'s crimes being committed against voters.\" Hasen emphasized that the Paterson case shows how difficult carrying out the kind of widespread fraud Trump insists is possible.

Election Fraud Case Draws A Trump Tweet But Suggests Safeguards Are Working When President Trump tweeted Sunday night about alleged fraud in a May special election in New Jersey, he tried to wrap it into his ongoing effort to claim voting by mail is less secure than in-person voting. \"Absentee Ballots are fine. A person has to go through a process to get and use them. Mail-In Voting, on the other hand, will lead to the most corrupt Election is USA history. Bad things happen with Mail-Ins,\" he tweeted. \"Just look at Special Election in Patterson, N.J. 19% of Ballots a FRAUD!\" Absentee Ballots are fine.

Just look at Special Election in Patterson, N.J. 19% of Ballots a FRAUD!— But election law experts say that Trump\\'s spotlight on the case also shows both how rare these kinds of cases are and the safeguards in place to protect the integrity of ballots. \"I had been predicting that the Paterson scandal was going to get to the president\\'s attention, because he\\'s been making so many unsupported claims about voter fraud that when there is an actual case involving election crime and absentee ballots, it\\'s not surprising that he\\'s making some hay out of it,\" said Rick Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California Irvine School of Law. Rumors of fraud in Paterson, N.J., had been piling up since the city held a special election for several city council seats on May 12. It was one of several local elections held that day that Gov. Phil Murphy ordered be conducted exclusively by mail-in voting because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Last Thursday, those rumors became criminal allegations. New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal charged Paterson City Councilman Michael Jackson, Councilman-elect Alex Mendez and two other men with voter fraud and other crimes. \\nThe investigation started after the U.S. Postal Inspection Service tipped off state law enforcement officials to hundreds of mail-in ballots stuffed in a Paterson mailbox. Other bundled ballots were discovered in another nearby city. In New Jersey, voters are expected to mail or submit their mail-in ballots themselves unless they certify a \"bearer\" to do it on their behalf.

'), Evidence(question='What is the stance of New Jersey officials on mail-in voting despite the fraud cases?', answer='New Jersey officials, including Governor Murphy, support mail-in voting and have implemented measures to ensure its security.', url='https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/08/what-you-need-to-know-about-njs-mostly-mail-in-ballot-elections-with-all-the-controversy.html', scraped_text='The state will also set up secure boxes where you can drop your ballot. There will be at least 10 in each county, officials said. That’s at least twice the 105 used during the July primary. “Ensuring not only that everyone gets a ballot, but that they have secure ways of returning that ballot, are central to our belief that our democracy stronger when everyone has the opportunity participate in it,” Murphys aid. “This mattered before the pandemic and has even greater urgency now.” All public schools in New Jersey will be closed to in-person instruction on Election Day. That, Murphy said, is to allow schools to be used as polling places. There will be a new online voter registration system. Murphy said it will be up by Sept. 4, “giving new voters an added ability to ensure they get registered.” You can check your registration status on the state’s elections website. You have until Oct. 13 to register. If you have problems, you ca visit the state’s elections website, call the state’s Voter Protection hotline at 1-877-NJVOTER, or reach out to your local officials. You can also track your ballot on the state’s elections website. That will show if it gets back to your county’s board of elections, New Jersey Secretary of State Tahesha Way said. “Now expect everything to take time, but stay on top of where your ballot is,” Way said. New Jersey had a similar setup in the July primaries. Voting was mostly mail-in, with some in-person voting across the state. The state also delayed a number of local elections earlier in the year and made those races vote-by-mail only. Murphy said the primary gave the state “the opportunity to see what worked and where we could make improvements to this kind of election.” But November will be larger scale — and higher stakes. Of course, there’s the big presidential race pitting Trump, a Republican, against former Vice President Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger. \\nPlus, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., is running for re-election against Republican Rik Mehta. And all 12 of New Jersey’s U.S. House seats are on the ballot. Turnout is expected to be much higher than the primary. He and other Republicans have spoken out against it repeatedly in recent weeks, warning it could lead to fraud and delayed results. Trump has argued without evidence that the 2020 election could lead to “the greatest fraud in history.” This could set up a collision course between Trump and Murphy after months of playing nice with each other during the pandemic. Voter fraud in the U.S. is historically rare, according to multiple studies and statistics. Nearly 1 in 4 voters cast ballots in the 2016 presidential election via mail. Still, New Jersey has had issues with mail-in voting this year. Some voters received the wrong ballots in the mail and some results took weeks to become official. Also, about 1 in 10 people who mailed in ballots in May’s special elections had their votes rejected. And there were allegations of voter fraud in the Paterson City Council race in May. State Attorney General Gurbir Grewal filed voting fraud charges against a city councilman and a councilman-elect. Murphy said Friday that this is actually “positive” because “law enforcement is all over it.\" “If you screw around, you will be caught and be held accountable,” he said. Democratic lawmakers want $3.6 billion in federal funding for mail-in voting and $25 billion to the U.S. Postal Service as part of coronavirus stimulus negotiations. “If they don’t get those two items, that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting because they’re not equipped to have it,” he said Thursday. Meanwhile, Thomas Marshall, the Postal Service’s general counsel and executive vice president, sent New Jersey’s secretary of state a letter July 30 saying that “certain deadlines for requesting and casting mail-in ballots are incongruous with the Postal Service’s delivery standards.” \\nThat creates a “significant risk” a ballot could be requested and returned too late to be counted, Marshall said. Still, some of his concerns involved residents requesting to vote absentee, which won’t be necessary because everyone will automatically be sent a ballot. Plus, the state is giving a week for clerks to receive ballots after Election Day. CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES: Live map tracker | Newsletter | Homepage Murphy said Friday “it’s ridiculous the post office is being politicized.\" But, he said, “I believe with all my heart it will be funded and cooler heads will prepare.” U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-9th Dist., has asked New Jeesey’s state attorney general to investigate whether Trump and U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy are trying to subvert the general election by slowing down delivery and refusing to adequately fund the Postal Service. State Sen. Kristin Corrado, R-Passaic, said it “makes absolutely no sense.” “If New Jersey residents can stand in long lines at Motor Vehicles, we should be able to wait 6 feet apart at the polls in November,” Corrado said. “The reality is most people don’t have to stand around too long waiting to vote. Many are in and out of polling centers in a matter of minutes.” State Sen. Michael Testa, R-Cumberland, said the plan will “create unnecessary confusion.” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House’s leading infectious disease expert, said recently: “If you go and wear a mask, if you observe the physical distancing, and don’t have a crowded situation, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t be able” to vote in-person. “I mean, obviously if you’re a person who is compromised physically or otherwise, you don’t want to take the chance,” he added. New Jersey is one of four states, plus Washington, D.C., to announce they will proactively mail ballots to voters before the election this year. Five states already have mostly mail-in elections: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, and Washingon. Our journalism needs your support. Please subscribe today to NJ.com.

Voter fraud from what we can tell is fairly rare and episodic.” A comprehensive review by the Brennan Center of Justice found that voter fraud in the United States is rare and does not approach rates that would be required to “rig” an election. An in-depth 2014 study published by the Washington Post found 31 credible instances of voter impersonation fraud from 2000 to 2014, out of a total of one billion ballots cast. There has been at least one instance of targeted mail-in ballot fraud this year, Dr. Atkeson said: “Mail-in voting is not filled with fraud, but the fraud that we find is targeted in places where election results are going to be close. An example of this is a municipal election earlier this year in Paterson, New Jersey that was overturned after charges of mail-in voter fraud caused nearly 20 percent of the ballots to be rejected. It would be very difficult to orchestrate some kind of national election fraud. But the fear in universal mail-in voting is that you’re creating more opportunity for mischief and losing chain of custody for ballots.” “Security checks should prevent the most egregious acts of fraud”More than half of states check the signatures on incoming mail-in ballots against signatures they have on file for registered voters, but Dr. Atkeson says that the rigour of these checks varies. “Every state has their own more or less stringent process for qualifying ballots.

A person has to go through a process to get and use them. Mail-In Voting, on the other hand, will lead to the most corrupt Election is USA history.

Just look at Special Election in Patterson, N.J. 19% of Ballots a FRAUD!— But election law experts say that Trump\\'s spotlight on the case also shows both how rare these kinds of cases are and the safeguards in place to protect the integrity of ballots. \"I had been predicting that the Paterson scandal was going to get to the president\\'s attention, because he\\'s been making so many unsupported claims about voter fraud that when there is an actual case involving election crime and absentee ballots, it\\'s not surprising that he\\'s making some hay out of it,\" said Rick Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California Irvine School of Law. Rumors of fraud in Paterson, N.J., had been piling up since the city held a special election for several city council seats on May 12. It was one of several local elections held that day that Gov. Phil Murphy ordered be conducted exclusively by mail-in voting because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Last Thursday, those rumors became criminal allegations. New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal charged Paterson City Councilman Michael Jackson, Councilman-elect Alex Mendez and two other men with voter fraud and other crimes. \\nThe investigation started after the U.S. Postal Inspection Service tipped off state law enforcement officials to hundreds of mail-in ballots stuffed in a Paterson mailbox. Other bundled ballots were discovered in another nearby city. In New Jersey, voters are expected to mail or submit their mail-in ballots themselves unless they certify a \"bearer\" to do it on their behalf. A bearer can collect and deliver ballots for no more than three voters in an election, and a candidate in the election cannot serve as a bearer. Jackson, the councilman, had more than three mail-in ballots that were not his and that did not identify him as the bearer, authorities said. Mendez allegedly delivered mail-in ballots that were not his even though he was a candidate and is accused of submitting voter registration applications for people who were not eligible to vote in that election. \"We will not allow a small number of criminals to undermine the public\\'s confidence in our democratic process,\" said Attorney General Grewal. The Passaic County Board of Elections rejected 3,190 ballots, about 19% of the mail-in ballots submitted, for the May 12 election in Paterson, but it is unclear how many were connected to the fraud allegations. In fact, there are many more common reasons for a ballot to be thrown out, such as a signature that doesn\\'t match election records or if the ballot was received after the deadline. It was also the first election in New Jersey conducted entirely vote-by-mail, and officials have warned of hiccups in matching signatures, processing paper ballots and receiving the mail on time. Although critics including Trump have claimed that a surge in mail-in voting will leave the election system prone to fraud, voting rights advocates in New Jersey say some of the same security features that exist for in-person voting also feature in vote-by-mail. \"There is a huge myth about voter fraud in this country,\" said Jesse Burns, executive director of the League of Women Voters of New Jersey. \\nWhen voters cast a ballot in person in New Jersey, they are required to sign a poll book to match their signature to election records. The same is true of mail-in ballots, and election officials check the ballot to make sure the signatures match. During the state\\'s primary on July 7, election officials will notify voters if their ballot was rejected because of a signature mismatch. Burns said it was not only a way for voters to ensure their vote is counted, but it also functions as a warning that another person may have attempted to vote fraudulently in their name. UC Irvine\\'s Hasen said the security measures used in New Jersey were likely enough to raise the suspicion of authorities. \"Even on this small scale, what you see is that having a conspiracy like this to try to affect the outcome of an election is very difficult to do without detection.\" Burns suggested the rare instances of election fraud are not typically committed by individual voters themselves but rather organized groups. \"This is not a voter fraud issue,\" she said. \"It\\'s crimes being committed against voters.\" Hasen emphasized that the Paterson case shows how difficult carrying out the kind of widespread fraud Trump insists is possible.

Mendez allegedly delivered mail-in ballots that were not his even though he was a candidate and is accused of submitting voter registration applications for people who were not eligible to vote in that election. \"We will not allow a small number of criminals to undermine the public\\'s confidence in our democratic process,\" said Attorney General Grewal. The Passaic County Board of Elections rejected 3,190 ballots, about 19% of the mail-in ballots submitted, for the May 12 election in Paterson, but it is unclear how many were connected to the fraud allegations. In fact, there are many more common reasons for a ballot to be thrown out, such as a signature that doesn\\'t match election records or if the ballot was received after the deadline. It was also the first election in New Jersey conducted entirely vote-by-mail, and officials have warned of hiccups in matching signatures, processing paper ballots and receiving the mail on time. Although critics including Trump have claimed that a surge in mail-in voting will leave the election system prone to fraud, voting rights advocates in New Jersey say some of the same security features that exist for in-person voting also feature in vote-by-mail. \"There is a huge myth about voter fraud in this country,\" said Jesse Burns, executive director of the League of Women Voters of New Jersey. \\nWhen voters cast a ballot in person in New Jersey, they are required to sign a poll book to match their signature to election records. The same is true of mail-in ballots, and election officials check the ballot to make sure the signatures match. During the state\\'s primary on July 7, election officials will notify voters if their ballot was rejected because of a signature mismatch. Burns said it was not only a way for voters to ensure their vote is counted, but it also functions as a warning that another person may have attempted to vote fraudulently in their name. UC Irvine\\'s Hasen said the security measures used in New Jersey were likely enough to raise the suspicion of authorities. \"Even on this small scale, what you see is that having a conspiracy like this to try to affect the outcome of an election is very difficult to do without detection.\" Burns suggested the rare instances of election fraud are not typically committed by individual voters themselves but rather organized groups. \"This is not a voter fraud issue,\" she said. \"It\\'s crimes being committed against voters.\" Hasen emphasized that the Paterson case shows how difficult carrying out the kind of widespread fraud Trump insists is possible.

      "Evidence(question='What is the stance of New Jersey officials on mail-in voting despite the fraud cases?', answer='New Jersey officials, including Governor Murphy, support mail-in voting and have implemented measures to ensure its security.', url='https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/08/what-you-need-to-know-about-njs-mostly-mail-in-ballot-elections-with-all-the-controversy.html', scraped_text='The state will also set up secure boxes where you can drop your ballot. There will be at least 10 in each county, officials said. That’s at least twice the 105 used during the July primary. “Ensuring not only that everyone gets a ballot, but that they have secure ways of returning that ballot, are central to our belief that our democracy stronger when everyone has the opportunity participate in it,” Murphys aid. “This mattered before the pandemic and has even greater urgency now.” All public schools in New Jersey will be closed to in-person instruction on Election Day. That, Murphy said, is to allow schools to be used as polling places. There will be a new online voter registration system. Murphy said it will be up by Sept. 4, “giving new voters an added ability to ensure they get registered.” You can check your registration status on the state’s elections website. You have until Oct. 13 to register. If you have problems, you ca visit the state’s elections website, call the state’s Voter Protection hotline at 1-877-NJVOTER, or reach out to your local officials. You can also track your ballot on the state’s elections website. That will show if it gets back to your county’s board of elections, New Jersey Secretary of State Tahesha Way said. “Now expect everything to take time, but stay on top of where your ballot is,” Way said. New Jersey had a similar setup in the July primaries. Voting was mostly mail-in, with some in-person voting across the state. The state also delayed a number of local elections earlier in the year and made those races vote-by-mail only. Murphy said the primary gave the state “the opportunity to see what worked and where we could make improvements to this kind of election.” But November will be larger scale — and higher stakes. Of course, there’s the big presidential race pitting Trump, a Republican, against former Vice President Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger. \\nPlus, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., is running for re-election against Republican Rik Mehta. And all 12 of New Jersey’s U.S. House seats are on the ballot. Turnout is expected to be much higher than the primary. He and other Republicans have spoken out against it repeatedly in recent weeks, warning it could lead to fraud and delayed results. Trump has argued without evidence that the 2020 election could lead to “the greatest fraud in history.” This could set up a collision course between Trump and Murphy after months of playing nice with each other during the pandemic. Voter fraud in the U.S. is historically rare, according to multiple studies and statistics. Nearly 1 in 4 voters cast ballots in the 2016 presidential election via mail. Still, New Jersey has had issues with mail-in voting this year. Some voters received the wrong ballots in the mail and some results took weeks to become official. Also, about 1 in 10 people who mailed in ballots in May’s special elections had their votes rejected. And there were allegations of voter fraud in the Paterson City Council race in May. State Attorney General Gurbir Grewal filed voting fraud charges against a city councilman and a councilman-elect. Murphy said Friday that this is actually “positive” because “law enforcement is all over it.\" “If you screw around, you will be caught and be held accountable,” he said. Democratic lawmakers want $3.6 billion in federal funding for mail-in voting and $25 billion to the U.S. Postal Service as part of coronavirus stimulus negotiations. “If they don’t get those two items, that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting because they’re not equipped to have it,” he said Thursday. Meanwhile, Thomas Marshall, the Postal Service’s general counsel and executive vice president, sent New Jersey’s secretary of state a letter July 30 saying that “certain deadlines for requesting and casting mail-in ballots are incongruous with the Postal Service’s delivery standards.” \\nThat creates a “significant risk” a ballot could be requested and returned too late to be counted, Marshall said. Still, some of his concerns involved residents requesting to vote absentee, which won’t be necessary because everyone will automatically be sent a ballot. Plus, the state is giving a week for clerks to receive ballots after Election Day. CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES: Live map tracker | Newsletter | Homepage Murphy said Friday “it’s ridiculous the post office is being politicized.\" But, he said, “I believe with all my heart it will be funded and cooler heads will prepare.” U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-9th Dist., has asked New Jeesey’s state attorney general to investigate whether Trump and U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy are trying to subvert the general election by slowing down delivery and refusing to adequately fund the Postal Service. State Sen. Kristin Corrado, R-Passaic, said it “makes absolutely no sense.” “If New Jersey residents can stand in long lines at Motor Vehicles, we should be able to wait 6 feet apart at the polls in November,” Corrado said. “The reality is most people don’t have to stand around too long waiting to vote. Many are in and out of polling centers in a matter of minutes.” State Sen. Michael Testa, R-Cumberland, said the plan will “create unnecessary confusion.” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House’s leading infectious disease expert, said recently: “If you go and wear a mask, if you observe the physical distancing, and don’t have a crowded situation, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t be able” to vote in-person. “I mean, obviously if you’re a person who is compromised physically or otherwise, you don’t want to take the chance,” he added. New Jersey is one of four states, plus Washington, D.C., to announce they will proactively mail ballots to voters before the election this year. Five states already have mostly mail-in elections: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, and Washingon. Our journalism needs your support. Please subscribe today to NJ.com. ')\n"

Furthermore, the widespread use of disposable masks has led to shortage of filter materials and problems with their haphazard disposal. In this study, a testing system that is based on standardized methods has been established and enhanced to reliably measure the particle filtration efficiency (PFE) of masks. Quality control experiments that examine the filtration efficiency of polystyrene latex (PSL) particles that are 0.1 µm in size and sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01–1.0 µm are conducted to determine the reliability of the testing system. Moreover, various textile materials are tested to fabricate 3-layer face masks, and the PFE of these masks is tested by using the proposed testing system to find the most suitable materials and the likelihood of their reusability. Among the tested materials, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) used as the membrane in the filter layer has the highest PFE of 88.33% ± 1.80%, which is mainly due to its dense and multilayer structure. The air permeability of the self-developed masks ranges from 1.41 ± 0.04 to 1.93 ± 0.08, less breathable than the commercial masks. The reusability of a mask that uses PTFE as the membrane in the filter layer is tested by gently washing the mask 30 times and then drying the mask in air before the PFE is measured. The PFE is only reduced by 10–20% after 30 washes, thus indicating the potential reusability of the mask. The findings in this study will contribute to reducing the pressure of mask shortages and are an environmentally friendly solution to the massive use of disposable masks. Keywords: COVID-19; Mask testing system; Reusable mask; Particle filtration efficiency. The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern because it is highly contagious with severe or even fatal health consequences. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, self-protection has become crucial to avoid contracting this disease. \\nAs a highly infectious disease, the two main routes of transmission include direct transmission (e.g., spraying droplets emitted from aerosolized particles through sneezing, coughing or talking), and indirect transmission (contact with surfaces that contain the virus or objects that have been in contact with an infected individual) (Liu, 2020; Ningthoujam, 2020; Tomar and Gupta, 2020). However, the former has been documented to be a more prevalent form of transmission, so an effective mask must be worn to obstruct the transmission of the virus and block its spread when conducting daily life activities (Bałazy et al., 2006; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2020). This has led to the unprecedented demand and shortage of masks, along with the problem of ineffective masks. On the one hand, there are a variety of different masks on the market. Although most commercially available masks claim effectiveness against contact with airborne particles, their actual performance has not been tested adequately. For example, Cheng (2020) reported that there was no quality control in face mask production in Pakistan. In Italy, in order to meet the huge demand of face masks, some industries have reset the production chain, shifting from the usual target products to the production of masks. However, the quality of the masks is questionable and needs to be tested (Amendola et al., 2020). In addition, Lam et al. (2020) examined 160 mask brands on the market and found that 48.8% of them were substandard and/or invalid. With COVID-19 as an urgent public health issue now, it has become imperative to test and validate the performance of these masks with reliable testing equipment. On the other hand, COVID-19 has led to the unprecedented demand for masks, which has resulted in a shortage of materials to fabricate them. Moreover, most of the masks currently found on the market are disposable (i.e., surgical, N95 and KF94 masks). \\nThe widespread use of such disposable masks is having a detrimental effect on the environment, as additional resources and human resources are needed to properly dispose of used masks which might otherwise end up in the oceans or landfills. As such, it is timely to develop effective yet reusable masks, not only to address the needs of the current epidemic but also to conserve resources. One of the key parameters of masks is their particle filtration efficiency (PFE) which reflects the ability of masks and/or filters to block the inhalation of different types of particles. Basically, PFE testing follows the methods stipulated in various standards, which include ASTM F2299 (the United States) and YY 0469-2011/GB19083-2010 (Chinese), and the standard provided by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In ASTM F2299, polystyrene latex (PSL) particles of a specific size are used to evaluate the PFE of a material. Although the applicable particle size range is from 0.1 µm to 5.0 µm, PSL particles of 0.1 µm are generally used for testing as it is the most penetrating particle size. In YY 0469-2011, sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01 µm to 1.0 µm are used as the index in PFE testing of masks, while the NIOSH standard is used to test masks to filter NaCl particles that are 0.3 µm in size. Although these standard methods provide basic instructions and parameters for PFE testing, they do not offer specific settings for testing systems and details of the equipment involved. Moreover, some of the standard methods have limitations. For instance, a device that is recommended for measuring particle concentration (an optical particle counter (OPC)) is low in accuracy and size-resolution (Rengasamy et al., 2011). Moreover, the standards do not strictly stipulate the size of the particles to be tested, thus resulting in differences and uncertainties in the results with the different testing agents and systems.

This reluctance has prompted an epic response. In a nearly unprecedented move, 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the WHO in July, urging the agency to recognize that airborne transmission of coronavirus by smaller aerosol particles is possible. The organization’s response was to subsequently update its position, stating that aerosol transmission “cannot be ruled out.” A glowing endorsement this was not—although, points out a spokesperson for the organization, “We have substantial guidance on the topic and speak repeatedly in press conferences and other venues about the importance of keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, precisely because of the potential of aerosol transmission in these settings.

Aerosol carry of the virus means that any indoor area where people gather in numbers—think restaurants, bars, churches, schools, rallies—is potentially a spreader of the disease, and depending upon the numbers, a superspreader.

Several diseases, including measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, have been shown to be transmitted by aerosols. Patients sick with the flu have the virus in their exhaled breath, and that virus has been shown to be present in the air. This is true for some other viruses, including those found in infants. Scientists in Wuhan, China, have identified coronavirus RNA particles in the air in hospital areas, although they haven’t yet proven that the particles are infectious. Lab workers at the University of Nebraska have published their finding that they, too, have identified coronavirus RNA in the air. “We have pretty strong circumstantial evidence, in a number of these superspreading indoor incidents, that there must have been a significant component of aerosol or airborne transmission,” says William Bahnfleth, chair of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Epidemic Task Force. Bahnfleth noted several examples, including a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, where multiple people without direct contact with one another became infected from a single individual, and a choir practice in Washington state where presumed droplet and aerosol spread from singingsickened 53 people, two of whom died. In an e-mail interview, researcher Bjorn Birnir shared his work, published in a preprint (a non–peer reviewed paper), that demonstrated how an infected person continues to exhale a cloud of droplets and aerosols.

ANOVA analysis is used to analyze the group effect. The p value is less than 2e-16 for the log 2 transformed case comparison, suggesting that the two groups are statistically significantly different. The Asian mask-wearing group clearly has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group. Thailand has the highest growth rate among the mask-wearing groups. However, the differences in the growth rate of confirmed cases between these two groups cannot be fully attributed to mask-wearing, but arise from many factors, such as clinical tests performed, complicated social, economic, and cultural differences, and varied public health polices enforcement. The preliminary comparison only provides the rationale to further evaluate if wearing masks is effective for controlling the infectious disease outbreak. Our study has six major assumptions with preliminary evidence. First, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathway includes airborne [1, 8, 22–24] with an R0 value exceeding that of influenza and SARS [16, 32, 33]. Second, a proportion of infected cases could be asymptomatic [36, 38, 46, 47]. Third, asymptomatic individuals could transfer the virus in the community [48, 49, 82]. Fourth, the public awareness of mask usage may increase as the pandemic spreads [64]. Fifth, the market could respond to consumer demand with a production increase and without supply chain problems [67]. Sixth, homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks [57, 60]. Thus, we project the best scenario as the pandemic spreads and by the end of the outbreak, the general population will be willing to wear a mask. Although wearing a mask is a low-cost and non-disruptive measure, wearing a mask has not been culturally widespread in many parts of the world [83]. Furthermore, for non-certified medical masks, individual errors could lead to ineffective mask fitting, which could reduce the benefit of wearing a mask [84]. \\nThere are limitations to those six assumptions. First, a recent study suggested that the virus was detected on the outer layer of COVID-19 patients' masks [85], which could invalidate the utility of a patient wearing a mask. However, although the virus was detected, the mask could still provide prevention by reducing the virus load to an adjacent healthy individual. Further studies on asymptomatic individuals wearing masks could be more convincing to validate the effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent pre-symptomatic transmission. Second, we assume random mixing and model the general population, but have not taken account children's role. Children are less likely to wear masks consistently to realize mask effectiveness. At the same time, the role of children in COVID-19 transmission is unclear [86]. Third, we assume the willing individual who has a mask can use the mask in the right manner and follow social distancing and other personal hygiene practices. There are discrepancies between willingness, perceived compliance, and real compliance [87]. Fourth, research shows that masks can be a source of contamination if not disposed of or replaced in timely manner The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis. Prevention such as vaccines is one of the most effective measures to mitigate such a catastrophic public health crisis. Prior to an available vaccine, NPIs such as wearing a mask can potentially reduce the virus transmission rate. Recent modeling studies suggest that timely and comprehensive NPIs are needed to prevent a secondary wave of COVID-19 [89]. However, timely implementations of NPI such as wearing a mask call for public awareness, a readily available market stockpile, and government advocacy and policies. For respiratory diseases caused by a rival agent through aerosol and droplet transmission routes, wearing masks could be a reasonable NPI to reduce the virus transmission efficiency and secondary transmission [5, 89]. \\nHowever, masks do not replace social distancing and other personal hygiene practices, such as hand washing. The effectiveness of any NPIs depends on compliance rates, contact rate reduction, the role of children, and asymptomatic cases in transmission. Our model analyzes the impact of wearing a mask that can efficiently filter viral aerosols during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Our study suggests that wearing a quality mask in combination with other NPIs can support hospital resource management during a pandemic. In a free market, the risks of not having enough masks for the general population may negatively impact timely responses to the outbreak. Appropriate public health policies and government subsidies could be necessary to manage similar crises in the future. Future studies on how to improve adherence and compliance rates will better position society for potential future respiratory disease outbreaks when the viral agent has a similar clinical attack rate. - 1.

The impact of this breakthrough seems almost too good to be true. We have found a disease control tool that, when used properly, can dramatically reduce the person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Studies have shown that this tool could reduce transmission by somewhere between 50% and 85%. The tool is cheap and remarkably low-tech. You can even make one at home. It has no significant side effects. And with each passing day, the scientific research showing the tool’s effectiveness gets stronger and stronger. If this tool were a vaccine or medicine, we’d be high-fiving each other and popping the champagne, knowing we’d discovered a crucial means to help prevent the spread of the pandemic. I’m talking, of course, about face masks—cloth, surgical, or even a bandanna. Face masks block the spread of respiratory droplets that can carry the novel coronavirus. But just as with so many other aspects of the response to COVID-19—including mass testing, contact tracing, and the early use of stay-at-home orders—the U.S. is once again squandering this opportunity. In many countries that have so far successfully controlled their COVID-19 epidemics, public health leaders, politicians, and the public have fully embraced the use of face masks with no hint of controversy. A recent study found that countries where masks were widely used soon after their COVID-19 outbreak began were more likely to keep their death rates low and to have a shorter outbreak. Countries like Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam that quickly adopted masking, along with other control measures such as social distancing and track and trace, have reported fewer than 6 deaths per million residents as a result of COVID-19. Yet in the U.S., where the death rate from COVID-19 is now 379 per million people, face masks have been weaponized for partisan purposes. \\nTaking their cues from President Trump, who has refused to appear on camera wearing a face mask and has said that Americans who wear masks are doing so to show their disapproval of him, many of his supporters now see wearing a face mask as an affront to personal liberty. According to the Washington Post, Republican leaders “are less likely to mandate them, and Republican voters are more likely to forgo, and even scorn, them.” Health officials who have promoted mask mandates have quit their jobs after receiving death threats. As a result of this alarming polarization, only 18 states and the District of Columbia are mandating face masks in public across the whole state. Only two—Massachusetts and Maryland—have Republican governors. Meanwhile, many Republican-led states are actively trying to subvert local measures. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts has gone so far as to say he will withhold federal coronavirus relief funds from local governments if they try and mandate mask use in their places of work. Rejecting face masks inevitably means embracing more COVID-19 cases and deaths. One U.S. study found that states with a mandate had a more rapid decline in daily growth rates of COVID-19 and estimated that mask use prevented up to 450,000 cases of COVID-19 by May 22, 2020. And while researchers at the University of Washington now predict that the U.S. could reach 180,000 COVID-19 deaths by October, they say we could prevent 33,000 of these deaths—more than half of the new deaths the model projects—if at least 95% of people wear a mask. That’s right. We can avert the deaths of 33,000 of our parents, grandparents, siblings, co-workers, teachers, bus drivers, mail carriers, nurses and store and factory workers by just sticking a one-dollar piece of cloth over our noses and mouths. So what’s stopping us? One problem is the “me first” culture in the U.S., in which anti-maskers claim that their right to go around unmasked in public matters more than saving lives.

Further studies on asymptomatic individuals wearing masks could be more convincing to validate the effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent pre-symptomatic transmission. Second, we assume random mixing and model the general population, but have not taken account children's role. Children are less likely to wear masks consistently to realize mask effectiveness. At the same time, the role of children in COVID-19 transmission is unclear [86]. Third, we assume the willing individual who has a mask can use the mask in the right manner and follow social distancing and other personal hygiene practices. There are discrepancies between willingness, perceived compliance, and real compliance [87]. Fourth, research shows that masks can be a source of contamination if not disposed of or replaced in timely manner The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis. Prevention such as vaccines is one of the most effective measures to mitigate such a catastrophic public health crisis. Prior to an available vaccine, NPIs such as wearing a mask can potentially reduce the virus transmission rate. Recent modeling studies suggest that timely and comprehensive NPIs are needed to prevent a secondary wave of COVID-19 [89]. However, timely implementations of NPI such as wearing a mask call for public awareness, a readily available market stockpile, and government advocacy and policies. For respiratory diseases caused by a rival agent through aerosol and droplet transmission routes, wearing masks could be a reasonable NPI to reduce the virus transmission efficiency and secondary transmission [5, 89]. \\nHowever, masks do not replace social distancing and other personal hygiene practices, such as hand washing. The effectiveness of any NPIs depends on compliance rates, contact rate reduction, the role of children, and asymptomatic cases in transmission. Our model analyzes the impact of wearing a mask that can efficiently filter viral aerosols during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Our study suggests that wearing a quality mask in combination with other NPIs can support hospital resource management during a pandemic. In a free market, the risks of not having enough masks for the general population may negatively impact timely responses to the outbreak. Appropriate public health policies and government subsidies could be necessary to manage similar crises in the future. Future studies on how to improve adherence and compliance rates will better position society for potential future respiratory disease outbreaks when the viral agent has a similar clinical attack rate. - 1.

The Asian mask-wearing group clearly has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group. Thailand has the highest growth rate among the mask-wearing groups. However, the differences in the growth rate of confirmed cases between these two groups cannot be fully attributed to mask-wearing, but arise from many factors, such as clinical tests performed, complicated social, economic, and cultural differences, and varied public health polices enforcement.

Fifth, the market could respond to consumer demand with a production increase and without supply chain problems [67]. Sixth, homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks [57, 60]. Thus, we project the best scenario as the pandemic spreads and by the end of the outbreak, the general population will be willing to wear a mask. Although wearing a mask is a low-cost and non-disruptive measure, wearing a mask has not been culturally widespread in many parts of the world [83]. Furthermore, for non-certified medical masks, individual errors could lead to ineffective mask fitting, which could reduce the benefit of wearing a mask [84]. \\nThere are limitations to those six assumptions.

Furthermore, the widespread use of disposable masks has led to shortage of filter materials and problems with their haphazard disposal. In this study, a testing system that is based on standardized methods has been established and enhanced to reliably measure the particle filtration efficiency (PFE) of masks. Quality control experiments that examine the filtration efficiency of polystyrene latex (PSL) particles that are 0.1 µm in size and sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01–1.0 µm are conducted to determine the reliability of the testing system. Moreover, various textile materials are tested to fabricate 3-layer face masks, and the PFE of these masks is tested by using the proposed testing system to find the most suitable materials and the likelihood of their reusability. Among the tested materials, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) used as the membrane in the filter layer has the highest PFE of 88.33% ± 1.80%, which is mainly due to its dense and multilayer structure. The air permeability of the self-developed masks ranges from 1.41 ± 0.04 to 1.93 ± 0.08, less breathable than the commercial masks. The reusability of a mask that uses PTFE as the membrane in the filter layer is tested by gently washing the mask 30 times and then drying the mask in air before the PFE is measured. The PFE is only reduced by 10–20% after 30 washes, thus indicating the potential reusability of the mask. The findings in this study will contribute to reducing the pressure of mask shortages and are an environmentally friendly solution to the massive use of disposable masks. Keywords: COVID-19; Mask testing system; Reusable mask; Particle filtration efficiency. The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern because it is highly contagious with severe or even fatal health consequences. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, self-protection has become crucial to avoid contracting this disease. ', 'context_after': 'The widespread use of such disposable masks is having a detrimental effect on the environment, as additional resources and human resources are needed to properly dispose of used masks which might otherwise end up in the oceans or landfills. As such, it is timely to develop effective yet reusable masks, not only to address the needs of the current epidemic but also to conserve resources. One of the key parameters of masks is their particle filtration efficiency (PFE) which reflects the ability of masks and/or filters to block the inhalation of different types of particles. Basically, PFE testing follows the methods stipulated in various standards, which include ASTM F2299 (the United States) and YY 0469-2011/GB19083-2010 (Chinese), and the standard provided by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In ASTM F2299, polystyrene latex (PSL) particles of a specific size are used to evaluate the PFE of a material. Although the applicable particle size range is from 0.1 µm to 5.0 µm, PSL particles of 0.1 µm are generally used for testing as it is the most penetrating particle size. In YY 0469-2011, sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01 µm to 1.0 µm are used as the index in PFE testing of masks, while the NIOSH standard is used to test masks to filter NaCl particles that are 0.3 µm in size. Although these standard methods provide basic instructions and parameters for PFE testing, they do not offer specific settings for testing systems and details of the equipment involved. Moreover, some of the standard methods have limitations. For instance, a device that is recommended for measuring particle concentration (an optical particle counter (OPC)) is low in accuracy and size-resolution (Rengasamy et al., 2011). Moreover, the standards do not strictly stipulate the size of the particles to be tested, thus resulting in differences and uncertainties in the results with the different testing agents and systems. '}, page_content='As a highly infectious disease, the two main routes of transmission include direct transmission (e.g., spraying droplets emitted from aerosolized particles through sneezing, coughing or talking), and indirect transmission (contact with surfaces that contain the virus or objects that have been in contact with an infected individual) (Liu, 2020; Ningthoujam, 2020; Tomar and Gupta, 2020). However, the former has been documented to be a more prevalent form of transmission, so an effective mask must be worn to obstruct the transmission of the virus and block its spread when conducting daily life activities (Bałazy et al., 2006; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2020). This has led to the unprecedented demand and shortage of masks, along with the problem of ineffective masks. On the one hand, there are a variety of different masks on the market. Although most commercially available masks claim effectiveness against contact with airborne particles, their actual performance has not been tested adequately. For example, Cheng (2020) reported that there was no quality control in face mask production in Pakistan. In Italy, in order to meet the huge demand of face masks, some industries have reset the production chain, shifting from the usual target products to the production of masks. However, the quality of the masks is questionable and needs to be tested (Amendola et al., 2020). In addition, Lam et al. (2020) examined 160 mask brands on the market and found that 48.8% of them were substandard and/or invalid. With COVID-19 as an urgent public health issue now, it has become imperative to test and validate the performance of these masks with reliable testing equipment. On the other hand, COVID-19 has led to the unprecedented demand for masks, which has resulted in a shortage of materials to fabricate them. Moreover, most of the masks currently found on the market are disposable (i.e., surgical, N95 and KF94 masks).

Despite the current limited scientific data detailing their effectiveness, we support the wearing of face coverings by the public when mandated and when in close contact with people whose infection  status they don't know. However, we also encourage everyone to continue to limit their time spent  indoors near potentially infectious people and to not count on or expect a cloth mask or face  covering to protect them or the people around them. The pandemic is not over and will not likely be  over for some time. As states and local jurisdictions reopen, we encourage people to continue to  assess and limit their risks. Cloth masks and face coverings likely do not offer the same degree of  protection as physical distancing, isolation, or limiting personal contact time.  Will face coverings 'flatten the curve' and stop the pandemic?  We have reviewed the many modeling studies that purport to demonstrate that cloth masks or face  coverings have the potential for flattening the curve or significantly decrease the number of cases. These studies fail to recognize several important facts:  • The filter performance of a cloth material does not directly translate or represent its performance on an individual, because it neglects the understanding of fit.  • Cloth masks or coverings come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials and are not made  • Transmission is not simply a function of short random interactions between individuals, but  rather a function of particle concentration in the air and the time exposed to that concentration.  • A cloth mask or face covering does very little to prevent the emission or inhalation of small  particles.

In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that  cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19  transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer  limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be  recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with  many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth  masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't  understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people  wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to  someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.

In one corner, we have scientists, epidemiologists, infectious-disease physicians, clinicians, engineers—many different experts in the medical community, that is—arguing that the spread of COVID-19 by aerosols (that is, tiny droplets that can remain airborne long enough to travel significantly farther than the six-foot separation we’ve been told to observe) is both real and dangerous. In the other, it’s the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), which until veryrecently have allowed only that aerosol spread is possible, not necessarily likely. And while watching experts going against governmental agencies isn’t always riveting stuff, this particular battle is terribly important. It has significant implications for how we as a country handle this epidemic, and what decisions we make going forward—and those decisions need to be made sooner, not later. On some level, this is a discussion of droplets versus aerosols. You’ve probably heard plenty this year about droplets: they’re larger in size and may be exhaled by someone talking, shouting, singing, coughing or sneezing. These droplets don’t travel far and fall quickly to the ground, one reason why a “social distance” of roughly six feet is seen as a safe one.

Aerosols, on the other hand, are tiny by comparison, nearly 10,000 times smaller than a human hair. They’re spread at far greater distances—20 to 30 feet—and can linger in the air for minutes to hours, infecting others. What constitutes a safe distance from aerosols is much harder to define, especially in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation. \", 'context_after': 'The idea of aerosol spread is neither new nor controversial. Several diseases, including measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, have been shown to be transmitted by aerosols. Patients sick with the flu have the virus in their exhaled breath, and that virus has been shown to be present in the air. This is true for some other viruses, including those found in infants. Scientists in Wuhan, China, have identified coronavirus RNA particles in the air in hospital areas, although they haven’t yet proven that the particles are infectious. Lab workers at the University of Nebraska have published their finding that they, too, have identified coronavirus RNA in the air. “We have pretty strong circumstantial evidence, in a number of these superspreading indoor incidents, that there must have been a significant component of aerosol or airborne transmission,” says William Bahnfleth, chair of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Epidemic Task Force. Bahnfleth noted several examples, including a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, where multiple people without direct contact with one another became infected from a single individual, and a choir practice in Washington state where presumed droplet and aerosol spread from singingsickened 53 people, two of whom died. In an e-mail interview, researcher Bjorn Birnir shared his work, published in a preprint (a non–peer reviewed paper), that demonstrated how an infected person continues to exhale a cloud of droplets and aerosols. These “build up over time to dangerous concentrations for everyone in the room,” Birnir says. While we don’t know exactly how much virus is needed to infect people or at what concentrations, these examples show that at some point the threshold is met and inhaled aerosols are the likely culprits. “Aerosol transmission plays a significant role in indoor environments and cannot be neglected,” says environmental science expert Maosheng Yao, a professor of engineering at Peking University. '}, page_content='Choosing a safe mask becomes difficult as well: an N95 respirator, for example, would be preferable to an ill-fitting cloth mask when it comes to filtering out these minuscule viral aerosols. For these and other reasons, some in the medical community suspect, our health agencies have been reluctant to accept the data on the airborne transmission of COVID-19—because if they do, they’re acknowledging a problem far more challenging even than what we’ve been dealt with so far. This reluctance has prompted an epic response. In a nearly unprecedented move, 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the WHO in July, urging the agency to recognize that airborne transmission of coronavirus by smaller aerosol particles is possible. The organization’s response was to subsequently update its position, stating that aerosol transmission “cannot be ruled out.” A glowing endorsement this was not—although, points out a spokesperson for the organization, “We have substantial guidance on the topic and speak repeatedly in press conferences and other venues about the importance of keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, precisely because of the potential of aerosol transmission in these settings. WHO has advice in the form of Q&As for the general public, and for people who manage public spaces and buildings and health facilities.” The CDC, meanwhile, posted on its Web site over the weekend that aerosolization may be “the main way the virus spreads,” then backtracked and removed the content from its site, claiming the language had been a draft of some proposed changes which were “posted in error.” This is a major point, not a minor one. Aerosol carry of the virus means that any indoor area where people gather in numbers—think restaurants, bars, churches, schools, rallies—is potentially a spreader of the disease, and depending upon the numbers, a superspreader. These are likely places with poor ventilation, where people not only are close together but may be speaking loudly, shouting, singing, cheering or booing, etc. '), Document(metadata={'url': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237691', 'context_before': 'A log transformed analysis is conducted to evaluate the growth rate of COVID-19 infections.

Thus, we project the best scenario as the pandemic spreads and by the end of the outbreak, the general population will be willing to wear a mask. Although wearing a mask is a low-cost and non-disruptive measure, wearing a mask has not been culturally widespread in many parts of the world [83]. Furthermore, for non-certified medical masks, individual errors could lead to ineffective mask fitting, which could reduce the benefit of wearing a mask [84]. ', 'context_after': 'However, masks do not replace social distancing and other personal hygiene practices, such as hand washing. The effectiveness of any NPIs depends on compliance rates, contact rate reduction, the role of children, and asymptomatic cases in transmission. Our model analyzes the impact of wearing a mask that can efficiently filter viral aerosols during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Our study suggests that wearing a quality mask in combination with other NPIs can support hospital resource management during a pandemic. In a free market, the risks of not having enough masks for the general population may negatively impact timely responses to the outbreak. Appropriate public health policies and government subsidies could be necessary to manage similar crises in the future. Future studies on how to improve adherence and compliance rates will better position society for potential future respiratory disease outbreaks when the viral agent has a similar clinical attack rate. - 1.

First, a recent study suggested that the virus was detected on the outer layer of COVID-19 patients' masks [85], which could invalidate the utility of a patient wearing a mask. However, although the virus was detected, the mask could still provide prevention by reducing the virus load to an adjacent healthy individual. Further studies on asymptomatic individuals wearing masks could be more convincing to validate the effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent pre-symptomatic transmission. Second, we assume random mixing and model the general population, but have not taken account children's role. Children are less likely to wear masks consistently to realize mask effectiveness. At the same time, the role of children in COVID-19 transmission is unclear [86]. Third, we assume the willing individual who has a mask can use the mask in the right manner and follow social distancing and other personal hygiene practices. There are discrepancies between willingness, perceived compliance, and real compliance [87]. Fourth, research shows that masks can be a source of contamination if not disposed of or replaced in timely manner The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis. Prevention such as vaccines is one of the most effective measures to mitigate such a catastrophic public health crisis. Prior to an available vaccine, NPIs such as wearing a mask can potentially reduce the virus transmission rate. Recent modeling studies suggest that timely and comprehensive NPIs are needed to prevent a secondary wave of COVID-19 [89]. However, timely implementations of NPI such as wearing a mask call for public awareness, a readily available market stockpile, and government advocacy and policies. For respiratory diseases caused by a rival agent through aerosol and droplet transmission routes, wearing masks could be a reasonable NPI to reduce the virus transmission efficiency and secondary transmission [5, 89]. \"), Document(metadata={'url': 'https://time.com/5861295/masks-covid19-spread-fighting/', 'context_before': '', 'context_after': 'Taking their cues from President Trump, who has refused to appear on camera wearing a face mask and has said that Americans who wear masks are doing so to show their disapproval of him, many of his supporters now see wearing a face mask as an affront to personal liberty. According to the Washington Post, Republican leaders “are less likely to mandate them, and Republican voters are more likely to forgo, and even scorn, them.” Health officials who have promoted mask mandates have quit their jobs after receiving death threats. As a result of this alarming polarization, only 18 states and the District of Columbia are mandating face masks in public across the whole state. Only two—Massachusetts and Maryland—have Republican governors. Meanwhile, many Republican-led states are actively trying to subvert local measures. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts has gone so far as to say he will withhold federal coronavirus relief funds from local governments if they try and mandate mask use in their places of work. Rejecting face masks inevitably means embracing more COVID-19 cases and deaths. One U.S. study found that states with a mandate had a more rapid decline in daily growth rates of COVID-19 and estimated that mask use prevented up to 450,000 cases of COVID-19 by May 22, 2020. And while researchers at the University of Washington now predict that the U.S. could reach 180,000 COVID-19 deaths by October, they say we could prevent 33,000 of these deaths—more than half of the new deaths the model projects—if at least 95% of people wear a mask. That’s right. We can avert the deaths of 33,000 of our parents, grandparents, siblings, co-workers, teachers, bus drivers, mail carriers, nurses and store and factory workers by just sticking a one-dollar piece of cloth over our noses and mouths. So what’s stopping us? One problem is the “me first” culture in the U.S., in which anti-maskers claim that their right to go around unmasked in public matters more than saving lives. '}, page_content='At long last, we have made a truly game-changing scientific breakthrough in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The impact of this breakthrough seems almost too good to be true. We have found a disease control tool that, when used properly, can dramatically reduce the person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Studies have shown that this tool could reduce transmission by somewhere between 50% and 85%. The tool is cheap and remarkably low-tech. You can even make one at home. It has no significant side effects. And with each passing day, the scientific research showing the tool’s effectiveness gets stronger and stronger. If this tool were a vaccine or medicine, we’d be high-fiving each other and popping the champagne, knowing we’d discovered a crucial means to help prevent the spread of the pandemic. I’m talking, of course, about face masks—cloth, surgical, or even a bandanna. Face masks block the spread of respiratory droplets that can carry the novel coronavirus. But just as with so many other aspects of the response to COVID-19—including mass testing, contact tracing, and the early use of stay-at-home orders—the U.S. is once again squandering this opportunity. In many countries that have so far successfully controlled their COVID-19 epidemics, public health leaders, politicians, and the public have fully embraced the use of face masks with no hint of controversy. A recent study found that countries where masks were widely used soon after their COVID-19 outbreak began were more likely to keep their death rates low and to have a shorter outbreak. Countries like Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam that quickly adopted masking, along with other control measures such as social distancing and track and trace, have reported fewer than 6 deaths per million residents as a result of COVID-19. Yet in the U.S., where the death rate from COVID-19 is now 379 per million people, face masks have been weaponized for partisan purposes.

Furthermore, the widespread use of disposable masks has led to shortage of filter materials and problems with their haphazard disposal. In this study, a testing system that is based on standardized methods has been established and enhanced to reliably measure the particle filtration efficiency (PFE) of masks. Quality control experiments that examine the filtration efficiency of polystyrene latex (PSL) particles that are 0.1 µm in size and sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01–1.0 µm are conducted to determine the reliability of the testing system. Moreover, various textile materials are tested to fabricate 3-layer face masks, and the PFE of these masks is tested by using the proposed testing system to find the most suitable materials and the likelihood of their reusability. Among the tested materials, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) used as the membrane in the filter layer has the highest PFE of 88.33% ± 1.80%, which is mainly due to its dense and multilayer structure. The air permeability of the self-developed masks ranges from 1.41 ± 0.04 to 1.93 ± 0.08, less breathable than the commercial masks. The reusability of a mask that uses PTFE as the membrane in the filter layer is tested by gently washing the mask 30 times and then drying the mask in air before the PFE is measured. The PFE is only reduced by 10–20% after 30 washes, thus indicating the potential reusability of the mask. The findings in this study will contribute to reducing the pressure of mask shortages and are an environmentally friendly solution to the massive use of disposable masks. Keywords: COVID-19; Mask testing system; Reusable mask; Particle filtration efficiency. The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern because it is highly contagious with severe or even fatal health consequences. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, self-protection has become crucial to avoid contracting this disease. \\nAs a highly infectious disease, the two main routes of transmission include direct transmission (e.g., spraying droplets emitted from aerosolized particles through sneezing, coughing or talking), and indirect transmission (contact with surfaces that contain the virus or objects that have been in contact with an infected individual) (Liu, 2020; Ningthoujam, 2020; Tomar and Gupta, 2020). However, the former has been documented to be a more prevalent form of transmission, so an effective mask must be worn to obstruct the transmission of the virus and block its spread when conducting daily life activities (Bałazy et al., 2006; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2020). This has led to the unprecedented demand and shortage of masks, along with the problem of ineffective masks. On the one hand, there are a variety of different masks on the market. Although most commercially available masks claim effectiveness against contact with airborne particles, their actual performance has not been tested adequately. For example, Cheng (2020) reported that there was no quality control in face mask production in Pakistan. In Italy, in order to meet the huge demand of face masks, some industries have reset the production chain, shifting from the usual target products to the production of masks. However, the quality of the masks is questionable and needs to be tested (Amendola et al., 2020). In addition, Lam et al. (2020) examined 160 mask brands on the market and found that 48.8% of them were substandard and/or invalid. With COVID-19 as an urgent public health issue now, it has become imperative to test and validate the performance of these masks with reliable testing equipment. On the other hand, COVID-19 has led to the unprecedented demand for masks, which has resulted in a shortage of materials to fabricate them. Moreover, most of the masks currently found on the market are disposable (i.e., surgical, N95 and KF94 masks). \\nThe widespread use of such disposable masks is having a detrimental effect on the environment, as additional resources and human resources are needed to properly dispose of used masks which might otherwise end up in the oceans or landfills. As such, it is timely to develop effective yet reusable masks, not only to address the needs of the current epidemic but also to conserve resources. One of the key parameters of masks is their particle filtration efficiency (PFE) which reflects the ability of masks and/or filters to block the inhalation of different types of particles. Basically, PFE testing follows the methods stipulated in various standards, which include ASTM F2299 (the United States) and YY 0469-2011/GB19083-2010 (Chinese), and the standard provided by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In ASTM F2299, polystyrene latex (PSL) particles of a specific size are used to evaluate the PFE of a material. Although the applicable particle size range is from 0.1 µm to 5.0 µm, PSL particles of 0.1 µm are generally used for testing as it is the most penetrating particle size. In YY 0469-2011, sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01 µm to 1.0 µm are used as the index in PFE testing of masks, while the NIOSH standard is used to test masks to filter NaCl particles that are 0.3 µm in size. Although these standard methods provide basic instructions and parameters for PFE testing, they do not offer specific settings for testing systems and details of the equipment involved. Moreover, some of the standard methods have limitations. For instance, a device that is recommended for measuring particle concentration (an optical particle counter (OPC)) is low in accuracy and size-resolution (Rengasamy et al., 2011). Moreover, the standards do not strictly stipulate the size of the particles to be tested, thus resulting in differences and uncertainties in the results with the different testing agents and systems.

In a nearly unprecedented move, 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the WHO in July, urging the agency to recognize that airborne transmission of coronavirus by smaller aerosol particles is possible. The organization’s response was to subsequently update its position, stating that aerosol transmission “cannot be ruled out.” A glowing endorsement this was not—although, points out a spokesperson for the organization, “We have substantial guidance on the topic and speak repeatedly in press conferences and other venues about the importance of keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, precisely because of the potential of aerosol transmission in these settings.

Aerosol carry of the virus means that any indoor area where people gather in numbers—think restaurants, bars, churches, schools, rallies—is potentially a spreader of the disease, and depending upon the numbers, a superspreader.

Lab workers at the University of Nebraska have published their finding that they, too, have identified coronavirus RNA in the air. “We have pretty strong circumstantial evidence, in a number of these superspreading indoor incidents, that there must have been a significant component of aerosol or airborne transmission,” says William Bahnfleth, chair of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Epidemic Task Force.

       "   'scraped_text': \"A log transformed analysis is conducted to evaluate the growth rate of COVID-19 infections. ANOVA analysis is used to analyze the group effect. The p value is less than 2e-16 for the log 2 transformed case comparison, suggesting that the two groups are statistically significantly different. The Asian mask-wearing group clearly has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group. Thailand has the highest growth rate among the mask-wearing groups. However, the differences in the growth rate of confirmed cases between these two groups cannot be fully attributed to mask-wearing, but arise from many factors, such as clinical tests performed, complicated social, economic, and cultural differences, and varied public health polices enforcement. The preliminary comparison only provides the rationale to further evaluate if wearing masks is effective for controlling the infectious disease outbreak. Our study has six major assumptions with preliminary evidence. First, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathway includes airborne [1, 8, 22–24] with an R0 value exceeding that of influenza and SARS [16, 32, 33]. Second, a proportion of infected cases could be asymptomatic [36, 38, 46, 47]. Third, asymptomatic individuals could transfer the virus in the community [48, 49, 82]. Fourth, the public awareness of mask usage may increase as the pandemic spreads [64]. Fifth, the market could respond to consumer demand with a production increase and without supply chain problems [67]. Sixth, homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks [57, 60]. Thus, we project the best scenario as the pandemic spreads and by the end of the outbreak, the general population will be willing to wear a mask. Although wearing a mask is a low-cost and non-disruptive measure, wearing a mask has not been culturally widespread in many parts of the world [83]. Furthermore, for non-certified medical masks, individual errors could lead to ineffective mask fitting, which could reduce the benefit of wearing a mask [84]. \\nThere are limitations to those six assumptions. First, a recent study suggested that the virus was detected on the outer layer of COVID-19 patients' masks [85], which could invalidate the utility of a patient wearing a mask. However, although the virus was detected, the mask could still provide prevention by reducing the virus load to an adjacent healthy individual. Further studies on asymptomatic individuals wearing masks could be more convincing to validate the effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent pre-symptomatic transmission. Second, we assume random mixing and model the general population, but have not taken account children's role. Children are less likely to wear masks consistently to realize mask effectiveness. At the same time, the role of children in COVID-19 transmission is unclear [86]. Third, we assume the willing individual who has a mask can use the mask in the right manner and follow social distancing and other personal hygiene practices. There are discrepancies between willingness, perceived compliance, and real compliance [87]. Fourth, research shows that masks can be a source of contamination if not disposed of or replaced in timely manner The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis. Prevention such as vaccines is one of the most effective measures to mitigate such a catastrophic public health crisis. Prior to an available vaccine, NPIs such as wearing a mask can potentially reduce the virus transmission rate. Recent modeling studies suggest that timely and comprehensive NPIs are needed to prevent a secondary wave of COVID-19 [89]. However, timely implementations of NPI such as wearing a mask call for public awareness, a readily available market stockpile, and government advocacy and policies. For respiratory diseases caused by a rival agent through aerosol and droplet transmission routes, wearing masks could be a reasonable NPI to reduce the virus transmission efficiency and secondary transmission [5, 89]. \\nHowever, masks do not replace social distancing and other personal hygiene practices, such as hand washing. The effectiveness of any NPIs depends on compliance rates, contact rate reduction, the role of children, and asymptomatic cases in transmission. Our model analyzes the impact of wearing a mask that can efficiently filter viral aerosols during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Our study suggests that wearing a quality mask in combination with other NPIs can support hospital resource management during a pandemic. In a free market, the risks of not having enough masks for the general population may negatively impact timely responses to the outbreak. Appropriate public health policies and government subsidies could be necessary to manage similar crises in the future. Future studies on how to improve adherence and compliance rates will better position society for potential future respiratory disease outbreaks when the viral agent has a similar clinical attack rate. - 1.

       "   'scraped_text': '\\nAt long last, we have made a truly game-changing scientific breakthrough in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The impact of this breakthrough seems almost too good to be true. We have found a disease control tool that, when used properly, can dramatically reduce the person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Studies have shown that this tool could reduce transmission by somewhere between 50% and 85%. The tool is cheap and remarkably low-tech. You can even make one at home. It has no significant side effects. And with each passing day, the scientific research showing the tool’s effectiveness gets stronger and stronger. If this tool were a vaccine or medicine, we’d be high-fiving each other and popping the champagne, knowing we’d discovered a crucial means to help prevent the spread of the pandemic. I’m talking, of course, about face masks—cloth, surgical, or even a bandanna. Face masks block the spread of respiratory droplets that can carry the novel coronavirus. But just as with so many other aspects of the response to COVID-19—including mass testing, contact tracing, and the early use of stay-at-home orders—the U.S. is once again squandering this opportunity. In many countries that have so far successfully controlled their COVID-19 epidemics, public health leaders, politicians, and the public have fully embraced the use of face masks with no hint of controversy. A recent study found that countries where masks were widely used soon after their COVID-19 outbreak began were more likely to keep their death rates low and to have a shorter outbreak. Countries like Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam that quickly adopted masking, along with other control measures such as social distancing and track and trace, have reported fewer than 6 deaths per million residents as a result of COVID-19. Yet in the U.S., where the death rate from COVID-19 is now 379 per million people, face masks have been weaponized for partisan purposes. \\nTaking their cues from President Trump, who has refused to appear on camera wearing a face mask and has said that Americans who wear masks are doing so to show their disapproval of him, many of his supporters now see wearing a face mask as an affront to personal liberty. According to the Washington Post, Republican leaders “are less likely to mandate them, and Republican voters are more likely to forgo, and even scorn, them.” Health officials who have promoted mask mandates have quit their jobs after receiving death threats. As a result of this alarming polarization, only 18 states and the District of Columbia are mandating face masks in public across the whole state. Only two—Massachusetts and Maryland—have Republican governors. Meanwhile, many Republican-led states are actively trying to subvert local measures. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts has gone so far as to say he will withhold federal coronavirus relief funds from local governments if they try and mandate mask use in their places of work. Rejecting face masks inevitably means embracing more COVID-19 cases and deaths. One U.S. study found that states with a mandate had a more rapid decline in daily growth rates of COVID-19 and estimated that mask use prevented up to 450,000 cases of COVID-19 by May 22, 2020. And while researchers at the University of Washington now predict that the U.S. could reach 180,000 COVID-19 deaths by October, they say we could prevent 33,000 of these deaths—more than half of the new deaths the model projects—if at least 95% of people wear a mask. That’s right. We can avert the deaths of 33,000 of our parents, grandparents, siblings, co-workers, teachers, bus drivers, mail carriers, nurses and store and factory workers by just sticking a one-dollar piece of cloth over our noses and mouths. So what’s stopping us? One problem is the “me first” culture in the U.S., in which anti-maskers claim that their right to go around unmasked in public matters more than saving lives. '},\n",

       "   'scraped_text': \"A log transformed analysis is conducted to evaluate the growth rate of COVID-19 infections. ANOVA analysis is used to analyze the group effect. The p value is less than 2e-16 for the log 2 transformed case comparison, suggesting that the two groups are statistically significantly different. The Asian mask-wearing group clearly has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group. Thailand has the highest growth rate among the mask-wearing groups. However, the differences in the growth rate of confirmed cases between these two groups cannot be fully attributed to mask-wearing, but arise from many factors, such as clinical tests performed, complicated social, economic, and cultural differences, and varied public health polices enforcement. The preliminary comparison only provides the rationale to further evaluate if wearing masks is effective for controlling the infectious disease outbreak. Our study has six major assumptions with preliminary evidence. First, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathway includes airborne [1, 8, 22–24] with an R0 value exceeding that of influenza and SARS [16, 32, 33]. Second, a proportion of infected cases could be asymptomatic [36, 38, 46, 47]. Third, asymptomatic individuals could transfer the virus in the community [48, 49, 82]. Fourth, the public awareness of mask usage may increase as the pandemic spreads [64]. Fifth, the market could respond to consumer demand with a production increase and without supply chain problems [67]. Sixth, homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks [57, 60]. Thus, we project the best scenario as the pandemic spreads and by the end of the outbreak, the general population will be willing to wear a mask. Although wearing a mask is a low-cost and non-disruptive measure, wearing a mask has not been culturally widespread in many parts of the world [83]. Furthermore, for non-certified medical masks, individual errors could lead to ineffective mask fitting, which could reduce the benefit of wearing a mask [84]. \\nThere are limitations to those six assumptions. First, a recent study suggested that the virus was detected on the outer layer of COVID-19 patients' masks [85], which could invalidate the utility of a patient wearing a mask. However, although the virus was detected, the mask could still provide prevention by reducing the virus load to an adjacent healthy individual. Further studies on asymptomatic individuals wearing masks could be more convincing to validate the effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent pre-symptomatic transmission. Second, we assume random mixing and model the general population, but have not taken account children's role. Children are less likely to wear masks consistently to realize mask effectiveness. At the same time, the role of children in COVID-19 transmission is unclear [86]. Third, we assume the willing individual who has a mask can use the mask in the right manner and follow social distancing and other personal hygiene practices. There are discrepancies between willingness, perceived compliance, and real compliance [87]. Fourth, research shows that masks can be a source of contamination if not disposed of or replaced in timely manner The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis. Prevention such as vaccines is one of the most effective measures to mitigate such a catastrophic public health crisis. Prior to an available vaccine, NPIs such as wearing a mask can potentially reduce the virus transmission rate. Recent modeling studies suggest that timely and comprehensive NPIs are needed to prevent a secondary wave of COVID-19 [89]. However, timely implementations of NPI such as wearing a mask call for public awareness, a readily available market stockpile, and government advocacy and policies. For respiratory diseases caused by a rival agent through aerosol and droplet transmission routes, wearing masks could be a reasonable NPI to reduce the virus transmission efficiency and secondary transmission [5, 89]. \\nHowever, masks do not replace social distancing and other personal hygiene practices, such as hand washing. The effectiveness of any NPIs depends on compliance rates, contact rate reduction, the role of children, and asymptomatic cases in transmission. Our model analyzes the impact of wearing a mask that can efficiently filter viral aerosols during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Our study suggests that wearing a quality mask in combination with other NPIs can support hospital resource management during a pandemic. In a free market, the risks of not having enough masks for the general population may negatively impact timely responses to the outbreak. Appropriate public health policies and government subsidies could be necessary to manage similar crises in the future. Future studies on how to improve adherence and compliance rates will better position society for potential future respiratory disease outbreaks when the viral agent has a similar clinical attack rate. - 1.

He was arrested at his home in California,\" reads a Facebook post, archived here, shared more than 400 times since it was published on September 12, 2020. Screenshot taken on September 22, 2020, showing the false claim on Facebook The same claim also circulated on social media in Spanish, Portuguese, German and Italian. Many posts give the source of the information as Toronto Today, a website describing itself on Facebook as offering \"radical and revolutionary news\". Also Read: No, Target Hasn\\\\\\'t Issued Black Lives Matter T-shirts As Uniform AFP Fact Check found the site was registered on July 8, 2020, according to domain name search site WhoIs. Since then, the website has published several viral false claims debunked by various fact-checking organisations, including Snopes and Lead Stories. On September 12, 2020, Toronto Today published an article headlined, \"Netflix CEO gets BUSTED with 13,000 files of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY\". Although the article has since been removed, an archived version is still accessible. AFP Fact Check ran a Google search of keywords from the article, such as the alleged \"13,000 files\" of child pornography and \"279 of the submitted files\" allegedly depicting victims known to authorities. We found US news reports about the arrest of a man in Utah state in December 2019. The man, described as a \"CEO\", reportedly possessed more than 13,000 files of child pornography, with 279 including \"identifiable child victims\". The Toronto Today story also mentions two organisations that were allegedly involved in investigating Hastings - the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force (ICAC) and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). \\\\nAFP Fact Check ran keyword searches for \"Hastings\" on the websites of the two organisations but found no information on his alleged arrest. Brandon Pursell, commander of the ICAC task force in central Califonia, told AFP Fact Check his task force \"did not arrest\" Hastings. Furthermore, the FBI did not release a statement on Hasting\\\\\\'s alleged arrest as it has done in the past for prominent figures, including former Uber CSO Joseph Sullivan, who was charged in August with attempting to cover up a hack of millions of customers\\\\\\' personal details. Hastings, who co-founded Netflix in 1997, was active on Twitter on September 12, 2020 -- the same day the Toronto Today article reported that he had been \"arrested at his home in California\". https://t.co/Wkr1S14YZV Some independent perspective on the Sundance award-winning French film Cuties— Reed Hastings (@reedhastings) September 12, 2020 He has since given interviews to media outlets including Wired and NPR promoting his book, \\\\\\'No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention\\\\\\'. Also Read: Map Of US Wildfires Shared To Cast Doubts On Climate Change The child pornography allegation comes amid calls for a boycott of Netflix over French film \"Cuties\" (\"Mignonnes\"), which critics say portrays its young stars in a sexualised way. Celebrities and politicians have tweeted the hashtag #CancelNetflix, used more than 200,000 times. Just a reminder to #CancelNetflix if you haven\\\\\\'t already. My dear friend & fellow child advocate @drjohndegarmo called @Netflix & after a calm and lengthy discussion on why #Cuties is child exploitation, promoting pedophelia, and is soft core porn, Netflix says they stand by it.— Meanwhile, US Republican Senator Ted Cruz wrote to the Justice Department asking it to investigate \"whether Netflix, its executives, or the makers of the film \\\\\\'Cuties\\\\\\' violated any federal laws against the production and distribution of child pornography\". \\')')"

Also Read: No, Target Hasn\\\\\\'t Issued Black Lives Matter T-shirts As Uniform AFP Fact Check found the site was registered on July 8, 2020, according to domain name search site WhoIs. Since then, the website has published several viral false claims debunked by various fact-checking organisations, including Snopes and Lead Stories. On September 12, 2020, Toronto Today published an article headlined, \"Netflix CEO gets BUSTED with 13,000 files of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY\". Although the article has since been removed, an archived version is still accessible. AFP Fact Check ran a Google search of keywords from the article, such as the alleged \"13,000 files\" of child pornography and \"279 of the submitted files\" allegedly depicting victims known to authorities. We found US news reports about the arrest of a man in Utah state in December 2019. The man, described as a \"CEO\", reportedly possessed more than 13,000 files of child pornography, with 279 including \"identifiable child victims\". The Toronto Today story also mentions two organisations that were allegedly involved in investigating Hastings - the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force (ICAC) and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). \\\\nAFP Fact Check ran keyword searches for \"Hastings\" on the websites of the two organisations but found no information on his alleged arrest. Brandon Pursell, commander of the ICAC task force in central Califonia, told AFP Fact Check his task force \"did not arrest\" Hastings. Furthermore, the FBI did not release a statement on Hasting\\\\\\'s alleged arrest as it has done in the past for prominent figures, including former Uber CSO Joseph Sullivan, who was charged in August with attempting to cover up a hack of millions of customers\\\\\\' personal details. Hastings, who co-founded Netflix in 1997, was active on Twitter on September 12, 2020 -- the same day the Toronto Today article reported that he had been \"arrested at his home in California\". https://t.co/Wkr1S14YZV Some independent perspective on the Sundance award-winning French film Cuties— Reed Hastings (@reedhastings) September 12, 2020 He has since given interviews to media outlets including Wired and NPR promoting his book, \\\\\\'No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention\\\\\\'. Also Read: Map Of US Wildfires Shared To Cast Doubts On Climate Change The child pornography allegation comes amid calls for a boycott of Netflix over French film \"Cuties\" (\"Mignonnes\"), which critics say portrays its young stars in a sexualised way. Celebrities and politicians have tweeted the hashtag #CancelNetflix, used more than 200,000 times. Just a reminder to #CancelNetflix if you haven\\\\\\'t already. My dear friend & fellow child advocate @drjohndegarmo called @Netflix & after a calm and lengthy discussion on why #Cuties is child exploitation, promoting pedophelia, and is soft core porn, Netflix says they stand by it.— Meanwhile, US Republican Senator Ted Cruz wrote to the Justice Department asking it to investigate \"whether Netflix, its executives, or the makers of the film \\\\\\'Cuties\\\\\\' violated any federal laws against the production and distribution of child pornography\". \\')')"

This claim is false.\\', url=\\'https://www.boomlive.in/world/posts-claiming-netflix-ceo-was-arrested-for-child-pornography-are-false-9919\\', scraped_text=\\'\\\\nPosts Claiming Netflix CEO Was Arrested For Child Pornography Are False Law enforcement officials said that there was no arrest and the rumour was published by a fringe news site, where it has since been removed. \"The CEO of a Netflix – Reed Hastings – has been caught by FBI agents with 13,000 files of child pornography. He was arrested at his home in California,\" reads a Facebook post, archived here, shared more than 400 times since it was published on September 12, 2020. Screenshot taken on September 22, 2020, showing the false claim on Facebook The same claim also circulated on social media in Spanish, Portuguese, German and Italian. Many posts give the source of the information as Toronto Today, a website describing itself on Facebook as offering \"radical and revolutionary news\". Also Read: No, Target Hasn\\\\\\'t Issued Black Lives Matter T-shirts As Uniform AFP Fact Check found the site was registered on July 8, 2020, according to domain name search site WhoIs. Since then, the website has published several viral false claims debunked by various fact-checking organisations, including Snopes and Lead Stories. On September 12, 2020, Toronto Today published an article headlined, \"Netflix CEO gets BUSTED with 13,000 files of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY\". Although the article has since been removed, an archived version is still accessible. AFP Fact Check ran a Google search of keywords from the article, such as the alleged \"13,000 files\" of child pornography and \"279 of the submitted files\" allegedly depicting victims known to authorities. We found US news reports about the arrest of a man in Utah state in December 2019. The man, described as a \"CEO\", reportedly possessed more than 13,000 files of child pornography, with 279 including \"identifiable child victims\". The Toronto Today story also mentions two organisations that were allegedly involved in investigating Hastings - the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force (ICAC) and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). \\\\nAFP Fact Check ran keyword searches for \"Hastings\" on the websites of the two organisations but found no information on his alleged arrest. Brandon Pursell, commander of the ICAC task force in central Califonia, told AFP Fact Check his task force \"did not arrest\" Hastings. Furthermore, the FBI did not release a statement on Hasting\\\\\\'s alleged arrest as it has done in the past for prominent figures, including former Uber CSO Joseph Sullivan, who was charged in August with attempting to cover up a hack of millions of customers\\\\\\' personal details. Hastings, who co-founded Netflix in 1997, was active on Twitter on September 12, 2020 -- the same day the Toronto Today article reported that he had been \"arrested at his home in California\". https://t.co/Wkr1S14YZV Some independent perspective on the Sundance award-winning French film Cuties— Reed Hastings (@reedhastings) September 12, 2020 He has since given interviews to media outlets including Wired and NPR promoting his book, \\\\\\'No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention\\\\\\'. Also Read: Map Of US Wildfires Shared To Cast Doubts On Climate Change The child pornography allegation comes amid calls for a boycott of Netflix over French film \"Cuties\" (\"Mignonnes\"), which critics say portrays its young stars in a sexualised way. Celebrities and politicians have tweeted the hashtag #CancelNetflix, used more than 200,000 times. Just a reminder to #CancelNetflix if you haven\\\\\\'t already. My dear friend & fellow child advocate @drjohndegarmo called @Netflix & after a calm and lengthy discussion on why #Cuties is child exploitation, promoting pedophelia, and is soft core porn, Netflix says they stand by it.— Meanwhile, US Republican Senator Ted Cruz wrote to the Justice Department asking it to investigate \"whether Netflix, its executives, or the makers of the film \\\\\\'Cuties\\\\\\' violated any federal laws against the production and distribution of child pornography\". \\')')"
